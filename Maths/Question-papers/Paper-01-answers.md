Here are the answers to the algebra practice questions.

### **Solutions**

**1. Solve the following simultaneous equations:**
The solution is **x = 2, y = -1**.

  * Rearrange the second equation to make *y* the subject: $y = 2x - 5$.
  * Substitute this into the first equation: $3x + 2(2x - 5) = 4$.
  * Solve for *x*: $3x + 4x - 10 = 4 \\implies 7x = 14 \\implies x=2$.
  * Substitute $x=2$ back into $y = 2x - 5$ to find *y*: $y = 2(2) - 5 = 4 - 5 = -1$.

**2. Express as a single fraction in its simplest form:**
The answer is $\\frac{1}{2}$.

  * Invert the second fraction and multiply: $\\frac{x^2 - 4x + 3}{x^2 - 9} \\times \\frac{x+3}{2x - 2}$.
  * Factorise each expression: $\\frac{(x-3)(x-1)}{(x-3)(x+3)} \\times \\frac{x+3}{2(x-1)}$.
  * Cancel the common factors $(x-3)$, $(x-1)$, and $(x+3)$ to get $\\frac{1}{2}$.

**3. Solve the equation $3x^2 - 7x - 5 = 0$:**
[cite\_start]The solutions are **x = 2.91** and **x = -0.57**. [cite: 687]

  * [cite\_start]Using the quadratic formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ with $a=3, b=-7, c=-5$. [cite: 1953]
  * $x = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(3)(-5)}}{2(3)} = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 + 60}}{6} = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{109}}{6}$.
  * $x \\approx \\frac{7 \\pm 10.44}{6}$.
  * $x \\approx 2.91$ or $x \\approx -0.57$.

-----

**4. Make *x* the subject of the formula:**
The answer is $x = \\frac{3y+1}{y-2}$.

  * $y(x-3) = 2x+1 \\implies yx - 3y = 2x + 1$.
  * Gather the *x* terms on one side: $yx - 2x = 3y + 1$.
  * [cite\_start]Factor out *x*: $x(y-2) = 3y + 1$. [cite: 493]
  * Divide to solve for *x*: $x = \\frac{3y+1}{y-2}$.

**5. Find their present ages:**
The **father is 40 years old** and the **son is 18 years old**.

  * Let the father's age be F and the son's age be S.
  * Equations: $F+S=58$ and $F+4 = 2(S+4)$.
  * From the first equation, $F = 58-S$.
  * Substitute this into the second equation: $(58-S)+4 = 2S+8 \\implies 62-S = 2S+8 \\implies 54=3S \\implies S=18$.
  * $F = 58 - 18 = 40$.

-----

**6. Simplify the expression:**
The answer is **16x³**.

  * [cite\_start]$(16x^8)^{\\frac{3}{4}} = 16^{\\frac{3}{4}} \\times (x^8)^{\\frac{3}{4}} = (\\sqrt[4]{16})^3 \\times x^{8 \\times \\frac{3}{4}} = 2^3 \\times x^6 = 8x^6$. [cite: 809, 811]
  * [cite\_start]$8x^6 \\times 2x^{-3} = 16x^{6-3} = 16x^3$. [cite: 803]

**7. How long would it take for 6 workers?**
It would take **1 hour and 20 minutes**.

  * [cite\_start]The relationship is $t = \\frac{k}{w^2}$. [cite: 701]
  * Substitute the known values: $3 = \\frac{k}{4^2} \\implies 3 = \\frac{k}{16} \\implies k=48$.
  * The formula is $t=\\frac{48}{w^2}$.
  * For 6 workers: $t = \\frac{48}{6^2} = \\frac{48}{36} = \\frac{4}{3}$ hours.
  * $\\frac{4}{3}$ hours is 1 hour and $\\frac{1}{3}$ of an hour, which is 20 minutes.

-----

**8. Solve the equation:**
There are **no real solutions**.

  * Multiply all terms by the common denominator $x(x+2)$: $5x - 3(x+2) = 1x(x+2)$.
  * $5x - 3x - 6 = x^2 + 2x \\implies 2x - 6 = x^2 + 2x$.
  * $x^2 = -6$. It is not possible to find a real square root of a negative number.

-----

**9. Solve the inequality and represent the solution on a number line:**
The solution is **-1 ≤ x \< 3**.

  * [cite\_start]Add 2 to all parts of the inequality: $-5+2 \\le 3x \< 7+2 \\implies -3 \\le 3x \< 9$. [cite: 1067]
  * [cite\_start]Divide all parts by 3: $-1 \\le x \< 3$. [cite: 1064]
  * The number line representation is:
    ```
      <---|---|---|---|---|---|--->
         -2  -1   0   1   2   3   4
              ●-----------○
    ```
    [cite\_start](A filled circle at -1 indicates it is included, and an open circle at 3 indicates it is not included). [cite: 1051, 1052, 1055]

**10. Find the width of the garden:**
The width of the garden is **6.25 meters**.

  * Using Pythagoras' theorem: $x^2 + (x+4)^2 = 12^2$.
  * $x^2 + x^2 + 8x + 16 = 144 \\implies 2x^2 + 8x - 128 = 0$.
  * Simplify by dividing by 2: $x^2 + 4x - 64 = 0$.
  * Using the quadratic formula: $x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{4^2 - 4(1)(-64)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16+256}}{2} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{272}}{2}$.
  * Since length must be positive, we take the positive root: $x \\approx \\frac{-4+16.492}{2} \\approx 6.246$.
  * Correct to 3 significant figures, the width is 6.25 m.

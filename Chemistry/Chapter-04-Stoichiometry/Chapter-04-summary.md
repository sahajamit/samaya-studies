### **1) Big‑picture overview**

This chapter introduces **stoichiometry**, which is the foundation of all chemical calculations. It's about using the relationships between reactants and products in a chemical reaction to figure out "how much." You'll learn about the concept of the **mole**, a unit that lets us count atoms and molecules by weighing them. This is crucial because atoms are too small to count individually. By understanding the mole, relative atomic mass, and balanced chemical equations, you can calculate the exact mass of reactants you need, predict the mass of the product you'll make (the **theoretical yield**), and even determine the chemical formula of an unknown substance. These skills are essential for chemists in labs and in industry to run reactions efficiently and without waste.

### **4) Core concepts explained**

#### **Relative Mass (p. 54)**
* The actual mass of an atom is incredibly small, so a relative scale is used for convenience[cite: 16, 17].
* The scale is based on the **carbon-12 isotope**, which is assigned a relative atomic mass ($A_r$) of exactly 12.00[cite: 18].
* The **relative atomic mass ($A_r$)** of an element is the weighted average mass of its isotopes compared to 1/12th the mass of a carbon-12 atom[cite: 24].
* For molecules (covalently bonded substances), the **relative molecular mass ($M_r$)** is the sum of the $A_r$ values of all atoms in the molecule[cite: 40].
* For ionic compounds, the term **relative formula mass ($M_r$)** is used and calculated in the same way[cite: 51, 111].

---

#### **The Mole and Avogadro's Constant (p. 55)**
* The **mole (mol)** is a unit for the amount of substance[cite: 64].
* One mole of any substance contains **$6.02 \times 10^{23}$** particles (atoms, molecules, or ions). This number is the **Avogadro constant**[cite: 64, 65, 81].
* The mass of one mole of a substance in grams is numerically equal to its relative atomic/molecular/formula mass. This is called the **molar mass** (g/mol)[cite: 88].
* Example: The $A_r$ of iron (Fe) is 56. Therefore, 1 mole of iron has a mass of 56 g and contains $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ atoms[cite: 71, 83].

---

#### **Moles and Gases (p. 58)**
* **Avogadro's Law** states that equal volumes of all gases, at the same temperature and pressure, contain the same number of molecules[cite: 257, 258].
* At **room temperature and pressure (r.t.p.)**, one mole of *any* gas occupies a volume of **24 $dm^3$** (or 24,000 $cm^3$)[cite: 233].
* This value, 24 $dm^3/mol$, is called the **molar gas volume**[cite: 234].
* This relationship allows for easy conversion between the volume of a gas and the number of moles.

---

#### **Moles and Solutions (p. 59)**
* The **concentration** of a solution tells us how much solute is dissolved in a certain volume of solution[cite: 260].
* Concentration is typically measured in grams per cubic decimetre ($g/dm^3$) or, more commonly in chemistry, **moles per cubic decimetre ($mol/dm^3$)**[cite: 261].
* A solution with a concentration of 1 $mol/dm^3$ is called a 1 molar solution[cite: 283].
* Remember that **1 $dm^3$ = 1000 $cm^3$**. To convert $cm^3$ to $dm^3$, you must divide by 1000[cite: 264].

---

#### **Calculating Formulae (p. 60-62)**
* The **empirical formula** is the simplest whole-number ratio of atoms of each element in a compound[cite: 395]. It can be found experimentally.
* The **molecular formula** gives the actual number of atoms of each element in one molecule[cite: 421]. It is always a whole-number multiple of the empirical formula.
* To find the molecular formula, you need both the empirical formula and the relative molecular mass ($M_r$) of the compound[cite: 407].
* **Comparison of Formulae:**
| Feature | Empirical Formula | Molecular Formula | Exam note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | Simplest ratio of atoms[cite: 395]. | Actual number of atoms[cite: 421]. | All ionic formulae are empirical. |
| **Example (Butene)** | $CH_2$ [cite: 401] | $C_4H_8$ [cite: 416, 417] | $C_4H_8$ is (CH$_2$) $\times$ 4. |
| **How to find** | From % composition or mass data[cite: 358]. | From empirical formula and $M_r$[cite: 407]. | You must calculate the empirical formula first. |

---

#### **Reacting Quantities, Yield, and Purity (p. 62-66)**
* A balanced chemical equation shows the **ratio of moles** of reactants and products[cite: 444, 447].
* The **Law of Conservation of Mass** states that the total mass of reactants equals the total mass of products in a chemical reaction[cite: 452, 453].
* The **limiting reactant** is the reactant that gets completely used up first, limiting the amount of product that can be formed[cite: 609, 610]. Other reactants are said to be in **excess**[cite: 609].
* **Percentage yield** compares the actual amount of product obtained in an experiment to the maximum amount that was theoretically possible[cite: 576, 581]. Reactions are rarely 100% efficient[cite: 566].
* **Percentage purity** calculates what proportion of a sample is the desired chemical, and what proportion is impurities[cite: 592].

### **5) Diagrams and micrographs (figures)**

* **Figure 4.2 (p. 56):** Shows two weighing scales.
    * One scale displays **24.00 g** with a coil of magnesium ribbon on it, representing 1 mole of Mg[cite: 92, 96].
    * The other scale displays **12.00 g** with a sample of powdered carbon in a petri dish, representing 1 mole of C[cite: 93, 103].
    * This visually demonstrates that one mole of different substances has a different mass.

### **6) Processes and cycles**

#### **Calculating Empirical Formula from Mass Data (p. 61)**
This process is used to find the simplest formula of a compound, for example, magnesium oxide (MgO).
1.  **Find the mass of each element:**
    * Mass of Mg = (Mass of crucible + Mg) - (Mass of crucible)[cite: 387].
    * Mass of O = (Mass of crucible + MgO) - (Mass of crucible + Mg)[cite: 388].
2.  **Convert masses to moles:**
    * Moles of Mg = Mass of Mg / $A_r$ of Mg (24)[cite: 389].
    * Moles of O = Mass of O / $A_r$ of O (16)[cite: 390].
3.  **Find the simplest whole-number ratio:**
    * Divide both mole values by the smallest of the two numbers[cite: 391].
    * The resulting numbers give the ratio of atoms in the empirical formula.
* **Inputs:** Mass of reactants.
* **Outputs:** Simplest whole-number ratio of atoms (empirical formula)[cite: 392].
* **Common error:** Forgetting to divide by the *smallest* number of moles to find the ratio.

---

#### **Calculating Reacting Masses (p. 62-63)**
This process determines the mass of product formed or reactant needed. Example: Heating limestone ($CaCO_3$) to make lime (CaO).
1.  **Write a balanced chemical equation:**
    * $CaCO_3(s) \rightarrow CaO(s) + CO_2(g)$[cite: 472, 473].
2.  **Calculate the molar masses ($M_r$)** of the substances involved.
    * $M_r$ of $CaCO_3 = 40 + 12 + (3 \times 16) = 100$[cite: 474].
    * $M_r$ of $CaO = 40 + 16 = 56$[cite: 477].
3.  **Write the reacting masses under the equation** based on the mole ratio.
    * The equation shows 1 mole of $CaCO_3$ produces 1 mole of CaO[cite: 474, 476].
    * So, 100 g of $CaCO_3$ produces 56 g of CaO[cite: 474, 477].
4.  **Use simple proportion (scaling)** to find the unknown mass.
    * If 100 tonnes of $CaCO_3$ produces 56 tonnes of CaO, then 10 tonnes will produce (10/100) × 56 = 5.6 tonnes of CaO[cite: 486, 487].

### **7) Formulae and calculations**

| Quantity | Formula | Units | Worked example (from text) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Number of moles (from mass)** | $moles = \frac{mass}{molar\ mass}$ | mol | Calculate moles in 108 g of Aluminium (Al, $A_r$=27): $moles = \frac{108}{27} = 4$ moles[cite: 164, 165]. |
| **Mass (from moles)** | $mass = moles \times molar\ mass$ | g | Calculate mass of 2 moles of iron (Fe, $A_r$=56): $mass = 2 \times 56 = 112$ g[cite: 133, 134]. |
| **Number of moles (gas volume)** | $moles = \frac{volume\ at\ r.t.p.}{24\ dm^3}$ | mol | Calculate moles in 72 $dm^3$ of ammonia ($NH_3$): $moles = \frac{72}{24} = 3$ moles[cite: 246, 247]. |
| **Gas volume (from moles)** | $volume = moles \times 24\ dm^3$ | $dm^3$ | Calculate volume of 5 moles of $CO_2$: $volume = 5 \times 24 = 120\ dm^3$[cite: 253]. |
| **Concentration (from moles)** | $concentration = \frac{moles}{volume}$ | $mol/dm^3$ | 0.25 mol of NaOH in 250 $cm^3$ (0.25 $dm^3$) solution: $conc = \frac{0.25}{0.25} = 1\ mol/dm^3$[cite: 280]. |
| **Number of moles (in solution)** | $moles = concentration \times volume$ | mol | Moles of HCl in 40 $cm^3$ (0.04 $dm^3$) of 0.2 $mol/dm^3$ solution: $moles = 0.2 \times 0.04 = 0.008$ mol[cite: 541, 543]. |
| **Percentage Yield** | $\% Yield = \frac{actual\ yield}{theoretical\ yield} \times 100$ | % | 28 g of $CO_2$ was made when 44 g was expected: $\% Yield = \frac{28}{44} \times 100 = 63.6\%$[cite: 578, 579]. |
| **Percentage Purity** | $\% Purity = \frac{mass\ of\ pure\ product}{mass\ of\ impure\ sample} \times 100$ | % | An 84 g sample contained 80.5 g of pure substance: $\% Purity = \frac{80.5}{84} \times 100 = 95.8\%$[cite: 604]. |

### **8) Required practicals / experiments**

#### **Experiment to find the formula of magnesium oxide (p. 60-61)**

* **Aim:** To determine the empirical formula of magnesium oxide by reacting a known mass of magnesium with oxygen.
* **Apparatus:** Crucible with lid, pipe clay triangle, tripod, Bunsen burner, heat-proof mat, weighing balance (p. 60, Figure 4.4).
* **Method:**
    1.  Weigh an empty, clean crucible with its lid[cite: 385].
    2.  Add a coil of magnesium ribbon and reweigh the crucible, lid, and magnesium[cite: 385].
    3.  Place the crucible on the pipe clay triangle and heat it strongly with a Bunsen burner[cite: 373].
    4.  Periodically lift the lid slightly with tongs to allow oxygen (air) to enter, but replace it quickly to prevent the white magnesium oxide powder from escaping[cite: 378, 383].
    5.  Heat until the magnesium has completely turned into a white powder[cite: 383].
    6.  Allow the crucible to cool completely, then reweigh it with the lid and contents[cite: 380].
    7.  Heat the crucible again for a few minutes, cool, and reweigh. Repeat this process (**heating to constant mass**) until two consecutive mass readings are the same, ensuring the reaction is complete[cite: 379, 381].
* **Variables:**
    * **Independent Variable (IV):** Mass of magnesium used.
    * **Dependent Variable (DV):** Mass of oxygen that reacts (and thus mass of magnesium oxide formed).
    * **Controlled Variables:** Heating time (initially), ensuring sufficient oxygen supply.
* **Safety:**
    * Wear eye protection at all times[cite: 364].
    * Do not look directly at the burning magnesium as it is very bright.
    * Handle the hot crucible and apparatus with tongs[cite: 365].
* **Sources of Error:**
    1.  Some magnesium oxide powder may escape as smoke when the lid is lifted[cite: 383]. This would lead to a lower final mass and an incorrect Mg:O ratio.
    2.  The reaction may be incomplete, meaning some magnesium remains. This would lead to a lower mass of oxygen being recorded.
    3.  Magnesium can also react with nitrogen in the air to form magnesium nitride ($Mg_3N_2$), which would affect the final mass.
* **Expected Results:** The calculations using the masses should lead to a mole ratio of magnesium to oxygen of approximately 1:1, giving the empirical formula **MgO**[cite: 391, 392].

***

### **9) Data handling and graphing**

This chapter primarily uses **tables** for data handling, especially for calculating empirical formulae.

* **What data is used:** Experimental masses of elements in a compound, or percentage composition data[cite: 358, 422].
* **Typical table structure for empirical formula calculations:**

| | Element 1 (e.g., C) | Element 2 (e.g., H) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mass (g) or %** | Mass of C | Mass of H |
| **Molar Mass ($A_r$)** | 12 | 1 |
| **Moles (Mass / $A_r$)** | Moles of C | Moles of H |
| **Mole Ratio** | Moles of C / smallest moles | Moles of H / smallest moles |
| **Simplest Ratio** | Round to nearest whole number | Round to nearest whole number |

* **Typical exam prompts:** "Use the data from the experiment to calculate the empirical formula of the compound." (p. 61, 68).

***

### **10) Common misconceptions and exam tips**

* **Misconception:** The terms "relative molecular mass" and "molar mass" are the same.
    * **Correct understanding:** Relative molecular mass ($M_r$) has no units[cite: 177, 189]. Molar mass has units of **g/mol**[cite: 88, 176]. They are numerically equal, but conceptually different.
    * **Quick tip:** If the question asks for "mass," your answer needs units (g). If it asks for "$M_r$", there are no units.

* **Misconception:** The big numbers in front of a formula in an equation (coefficients) are part of the $M_r$ calculation.
    * **Correct understanding:** The coefficient tells you the **number of moles**. The $M_r$ is calculated for a single formula unit only. You multiply the $M_r$ by the coefficient later to find the total reacting mass.
    * **Quick tip:** For $2H_2O$, first find $M_r$ of $H_2O$ (18), *then* multiply by 2 for the reacting mass (36 g)[cite: 117].

* **Misconception:** You can just use the ratio of masses from an experiment to find the formula.
    * **Correct understanding:** You MUST convert mass to **moles** first. Chemical formulae represent the ratio of atoms (moles), not the ratio of masses.
    * **Quick tip:** Always follow the steps: Mass → Moles → Ratio.

* **Misconception:** Forgetting to convert volumes in $cm^3$ to $dm^3$ for concentration calculations.
    * **Correct understanding:** Concentration is in $mol/dm^3$. All volumes must be in $dm^3$.
    * **Quick tip:** Remember **1 $dm^3$ = 1000 $cm^3$**. To convert $cm^3 \rightarrow dm^3$, divide by 1000. For 250 $cm^3$, use 0.250 $dm^3$ in your formula[cite: 264].

        * Convert volume to $dm^3$: 480 $cm^3$ / 1000 = 0.48 $dm^3$.
        * Moles = volume / 24 = 0.48 / 24 = 0.02 mol.

5.  What is the difference between an empirical formula and a molecular formula?
    * **Answer:** The empirical formula shows the simplest whole-number ratio of atoms in a compound [cite: 395], while the molecular formula shows the actual number of atoms of each element in one molecule[cite: 421].

a) **Calculate** the empirical formula of compound **X**. ($A_r$: C=12, H=1, O=16) [3]
b) The relative molecular mass, $M_r$, of compound **X** is 180. **Determine** the molecular formula of **X**. [2]

* **Marking points (a):**
    * **(1)** Divide % by $A_r$ for each element:
        * C: 40.0 / 12 = 3.33
        * H: 6.7 / 1 = 6.7
        * O: 53.3 / 16 = 3.33
    * **(1)** Divide by the smallest value (3.33) to find the ratio:
        * C: 3.33 / 3.33 = 1
        * H: 6.7 / 3.33 = 2
        * O: 3.33 / 3.33 = 1
    * **(1)** State the empirical formula: $CH_2O$.

* **Marking points (b):**
    * **(1)** Calculate the mass of the empirical formula unit: $12 + (2 \times 1) + 16 = 30$.
    * **(1)** Find the multiple (n) and the molecular formula:
        * n = ($M_r$ of molecule) / ($M_r$ of empirical formula) = 180 / 30 = 6.
        * Molecular formula = $(CH_2O)_6 = C_6H_{12}O_6$.

**Question 2**
Iron(III) oxide reacts with carbon monoxide in a blast furnace to produce iron.
$Fe_2O_3(s) + 3CO(g) \rightarrow 2Fe(s) + 3CO_2(g)$
a) **Calculate** the maximum mass of iron that can be produced from 800 tonnes of iron(III) oxide ($Fe_2O_3$). ($A_r$: Fe=56, O=16) [3]
b) In the reaction, 2.4 g of iron(III) oxide was heated with excess carbon monoxide, and 1.4 g of iron was produced. **Calculate** the percentage yield. [2]

* **Marking points (a):**
    * **(1)** Calculate molar masses:
        * $M_r$ of $Fe_2O_3 = (2 \times 56) + (3 \times 16) = 112 + 48 = 160$.
        * $A_r$ of Fe = 56. The equation has 2Fe, so mass is $2 \times 56 = 112$.
    * **(1)** State the mass ratio from the equation: 160 tonnes of $Fe_2O_3$ produces 112 tonnes of Fe.
    * **(1)** Calculate the mass of iron produced from 800 tonnes:
        * Mass Fe = $(112 / 160) \times 800 = 560$ tonnes.

* **Marking points (b):**
    * **(1)** Calculate the theoretical yield of iron from 2.4 g of $Fe_2O_3$:
        * Theoretical Mass Fe = $(112 / 160) \times 2.4 = 1.68$ g.
    * **(1)** Calculate the percentage yield:
        * % Yield = (actual yield / theoretical yield) $\times 100 = (1.4 / 1.68) \times 100 = 83.3\%$.

### **14) 60-second recap**

This chapter is all about the **mole**, the chemist's unit for counting particles. We start with **relative atomic mass ($A_r$)** to compare the masses of different atoms. We learn that one mole of any substance contains $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ particles and its mass in grams is its **molar mass**. Using this, we can convert between mass and moles for solids, between volume and moles for gases (using 24 $dm^3$), and between concentration, volume, and moles for solutions. Balanced equations give us the mole ratio, allowing us to calculate reacting masses. We can also work backwards from experimental mass data to find a compound's **empirical and molecular formula**. Finally, we assess a reaction's efficiency using **percentage yield** and determine a sample's purity.

### 1\) Big-picture overview

This chapter is your guide to the chemistry lab. It covers the essential tools and techniques you'll use to conduct experiments safely and accurately. You'll learn how to measure fundamental quantities like time, temperature, mass, and volume using the correct apparatus, from stopwatches to burettes (p. 221-223). A major focus is on separating mixtures. You'll explore methods like filtration for solids and liquids, distillation for separating liquids with different boiling points, and chromatography for separating dissolved substances like inks (p. 224-231). Finally, the chapter introduces **qualitative analysis**, a set of chemical detective skills to identify unknown ions and gases based on their unique reactions, colours, and properties (p. 233). Mastering these practical skills is crucial for understanding how chemists gather and interpret data.

### 4\) Core concepts explained

#### **14.1 Apparatus for Measurement** (p. 221-224)

  * **Time:** Measured in hours (h), minutes (min), and seconds (s)[cite: 33]. For rate of reaction experiments, a **stopwatch** measuring to a hundredth of a second is used for accuracy[cite: 32].
  * **Temperature:** Measured in degrees Celsius ($^{\\circ}C$) using a thermometer[cite: 43]. The scale is based on water's freezing point ($0^{\\circ}C$) and boiling point ($100^{\\circ}C$)[cite: 45]. To ensure accuracy, the eye must be level with the liquid meniscus to avoid **parallax error**[cite: 48].
  * **Mass:** Measured in grams (g) and kilograms (kg) using an **electronic balance**[cite: 55]. A typical lab balance has a precision of 0.01 g[cite: 54]. You should wait for the reading to be steady before recording it[cite: 56].
  * **Volume of Liquids:** Measured in cubic centimetres ($cm^{3}$) or cubic decimetres ($dm^{3}$)[cite: 87]. ($1\~dm^{3} = 1000\~cm^{3}$) [cite: 88].
      * **Measuring Cylinder:** For approximate measurements[cite: 84].
      * **Pipette:** Used to accurately measure a fixed volume of liquid, e.g., for a titration[cite: 75, 81].
      * **Burette:** Used to accurately measure variable volumes of liquid, often for adding the **titrant** in a titration[cite: 75, 77]. Precision is typically 0.1 $cm^{3}$, but can be read to the nearest 0.05 $cm^{3}$[cite: 93, 96].
  * **Volume of Gases:** Measured using a **gas syringe**, typically up to 100 $cm^{3}$[cite: 105, 106]. As gas is produced in a reaction, it pushes the plunger out, and the volume can be read from the scale[cite: 122].

#### **14.2 Separating Mixtures** (p. 224-231)

This section covers methods to separate substances based on their different physical properties.

  * **Separating an Insoluble Solid from a Liquid**
      * **Filtration:** The mixture is poured through filter paper in a funnel. The insoluble solid (**residue**) is trapped, while the liquid (**filtrate**) passes through[cite: 195, 199]. \* **Separating a Soluble Solid from a Solvent**
      * **Evaporation:** The solution is heated, causing the solvent to turn into a gas and leave the dissolved solid behind[cite: 232]. This is used when you don't need to keep the solvent.
      * **Crystallisation:** The solvent is evaporated slowly from a **saturated solution** until crystals of the solute form[cite: 243, 247].
      * **Simple Distillation:** Used to recover the solvent. The solution is boiled, the vapour is cooled in a **Liebig condenser**, and the pure liquid solvent (**distillate**) is collected[cite: 237, 263].
  * **Separating Mixtures of Liquids**
      * **Immiscible Liquids:** A **separating funnel** is used. The liquids form separate layers due to different densities; the tap is opened to run off the bottom layer[cite: 269, 271].
      * **Miscible Liquids:** **Fractional distillation** is used. The liquids must have different boiling points[cite: 285, 287]. The liquid with the lower boiling point evaporates first, rises through a **fractionating column**, condenses, and is collected[cite: 293]. This process is used to separate ethanol and water or fractions of crude oil[cite: 298].
  * **Chromatography**
      * Used to separate dissolved substances, like dyes in ink[cite: 345].
      * A spot of the mixture is placed on a **baseline** (drawn in pencil) on chromatography paper[cite: 347, 349].
      * The paper is placed in a beaker with a solvent, ensuring the solvent level is below the baseline[cite: 350].
      * As the solvent moves up the paper, it carries the dyes with it. Dyes that are more soluble in the solvent and less absorbed by the paper travel further[cite: 380, 381]. The final separated pattern is a **chromatogram**[cite: 383].

-----

#### **Criteria for Purity** (p. 232)

In chemistry, a **pure substance** is a single element or compound[cite: 436]. Impurities affect physical properties.

| Purity Test | Pure Substance | Impure Substance (Mixture) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Melting Point** | Melts at a sharp, fixed temperature[cite: 451]. | Melts over a range of temperatures[cite: 452]. |
| **Boiling Point** | Boils at a sharp, fixed temperature[cite: 453]. | Boils over a range of temperatures[cite: 454]. |
| **Chromatography** | Produces a single spot on the chromatogram[cite: 455]. | Produces several spots[cite: 456]. |

-----

#### **14.3 Qualitative Analysis** (p. 233-236)

This involves a series of tests to identify unknown ions and gases.

  * **Flame Tests for Cations:** A sample is placed in a Bunsen flame, and the colour produced identifies the metal ion[cite: 491].
      * **Lithium ($Li^{+}$):** Red [cite: 489]
      * **Sodium ($Na^{+}$):** Yellow [cite: 489]
      * **Potassium ($K^{+}$):** Lilac [cite: 489]
      * **Calcium ($Ca^{2+}$):** Orange-red [cite: 489]
      * **Copper ($Cu^{2+}$):** Blue-green [cite: 489]
  * **Tests for Aqueous Cations:** Adding a reagent causes a precipitate (insoluble solid) to form. The colour and behaviour in excess reagent are key identifiers.
      * **Using Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH):** See Table 14.3 (p. 234). For example, adding NaOH to a solution with $Cu^{2+}$ ions gives a light blue precipitate that is insoluble in excess[cite: 502].
      * **Using Aqueous Ammonia (NH₃):** See Table 14.4 (p. 235). For example, adding aqueous ammonia to a solution with $Cu^{2+}$ ions gives a light blue precipitate which dissolves in excess to form a dark blue solution[cite: 509].
  * **Tests for Aqueous Anions:** See Table 14.5 (p. 236).
      * **Carbonate ($CO\_3^{2-}$):** Add dilute acid. Effervescence (fizzing) occurs as $CO\_2$ gas is produced[cite: 534, 540].
      * **Halides ($Cl^{-}$, $Br^{-}$, $I^{-}$):** Add dilute nitric acid, then silver nitrate solution. Precipitates form: White for chloride, cream for bromide, yellow for iodide[cite: 535, 540, 541, 542].
      * **Sulfate ($SO\_4^{2-}$):** Add dilute acid, then barium nitrate solution. A white precipitate forms[cite: 537, 545].
  * **Tests for Gases:** See Table 14.6 (p. 236).
      * **Hydrogen ($H\_2$):** A lit splint makes a 'squeaky pop' sound[cite: 549].
      * **Oxygen ($O\_2$):** A glowing splint relights[cite: 549].
      * **Carbon Dioxide ($CO\_2$):** Bubbling through limewater (calcium hydroxide solution) turns it cloudy/milky[cite: 549].
      * **Ammonia ($NH\_3$):** Has a pungent smell and turns damp red litmus paper blue[cite: 549].
      * **Chlorine ($Cl\_2$):** Has a choking smell and bleaches damp litmus paper (turns it white)[cite: 549].

### 5\) Diagrams and micrographs (figures)

  * **Reading a Thermometer (Figure 14.3, p. 222):** Shows the importance of having your eye level with the top of the liquid to avoid parallax error. Viewing from above gives a higher reading; viewing from below gives a lower reading.
  * **Reading a Measuring Cylinder (Figure 14.6, p. 223):** Shows the curved meniscus of a liquid. The volume should be read from the bottom of the curve with the eye at the same level.
  * **Gas Collection (Figure 14.8, p. 224):** Depicts a flask where a gas-producing reaction occurs, connected by a tube to a gas syringe. As gas is made, the plunger is pushed out, allowing the volume to be read from the scale on the syringe.
  * **Simple Distillation Apparatus (Figure 14.14, p. 227):**
      * **Flask:** Contains the solution to be heated.
      * **Thermometer:** Placed at the neck of the flask to measure the boiling point of the substance that is evaporating.
      * **Liebig Condenser:** A glass tube with an outer jacket through which cold water flows. It cools the vapour, causing it to condense back into a liquid.
      * **Collection Flask/Beaker:** Catches the pure liquid distillate.
  * **Fractional Distillation Apparatus (Figure 14.18, p. 229):**
      * Similar to simple distillation but includes a **Fractionating Column** placed between the flask and the condenser.
      * **Fractionating Column:** A glass column packed with glass rods or beads, providing a large surface area for repeated condensation and vaporisation, which separates the liquids more effectively.
  * **Paper Chromatography (Figure 14.23, p. 231):**
      * Shows three stages: **Before** (a spot of ink on a pencil baseline), **During** (paper in a beaker with solvent moving up), and **After** (the ink has separated into different coloured spots at different heights).

### 6\) Processes and cycles

#### **Paper Chromatography**

1.  **Preparation:** Draw a faint pencil line (the **baseline**) about 1 cm from the bottom of a piece of chromatography paper[cite: 347]. A pencil is used because graphite is insoluble and won't interfere with the experiment[cite: 348].
2.  **Application:** Place a small, concentrated spot of the mixture (e.g., ink) on the baseline[cite: 349].
3.  **Development:** Place the paper in a beaker containing a small amount of a suitable solvent. The solvent level must be **below** the baseline[cite: 350]. Cover the beaker to create a saturated atmosphere and prevent solvent evaporation[cite: 351].
4.  **Separation:** The solvent moves up the paper by capillary action. As it passes the baseline, it dissolves the mixture and carries it up the paper[cite: 380].
5.  **Result:** The substances in the mixture separate based on their different solubilities in the solvent and attraction to the paper. The most soluble substance travels the farthest[cite: 381, 382]. The resulting paper with separated spots is called a chromatogram[cite: 383].
6.  **Analysis:** If the substances are colourless, a **locating agent** is sprayed on the chromatogram to make them visible[cite: 425]. The position of each spot can be used to calculate an **Rƒ value**.

| Quantity | Formula | Units | Typical values | Worked example (p. 232) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

Distance travelled by solvent = 10.0 cm[cite: 431]. \<br\> $R\_{f} = \\frac{2.5}{10.0} = 0.25$[cite: 432]. |

### 8\) Required practicals / experiments

#### **Experiment: Identifying an Unknown Cation and Anion in Compound A** (p. 237)

  * **Aim:** To use qualitative analysis to identify the ions in an unknown compound A.
  * **Apparatus:** Test tubes, beaker, Bunsen burner, measuring cylinder, droppers.
  * **Method & Results:**
    1.  **Appearance:** Dissolve compound A in water. A colourless solution is produced[cite: 567].
    2.  **Cation Test 1:** To a sample of the solution, add aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) dropwise, then in excess.
          * **Observation:** A white precipitate forms, which dissolves in excess NaOH[cite: 567].
          * **Conclusion:** This suggests the cation could be $Al^{3+}$ or $Zn^{2+}$[cite: 502].
    3.  **Cation Test 2:** To a second sample, add aqueous ammonia (NH₃) dropwise, then in excess.
          * **Observation:** A white precipitate forms, which is insoluble in excess NH₃[cite: 567].
          * **Conclusion:** This confirms the cation is **$Al^{3+}$**. (A $Zn^{2+}$ precipitate would dissolve in excess ammonia) [cite: 509].
    4.  **Anion Test:** To a third sample, add aqueous NaOH and aluminium foil, then warm gently.
          * **Observation:** A gas is produced which turns moist red litmus paper blue[cite: 567].
          * **Conclusion:** This is the positive test for the **nitrate ion ($NO\_3^{-}$)**. The gas produced is ammonia[cite: 536, 544].
  * **Final Identification:** The compound A is **Aluminium Nitrate**, $Al(NO\_3)\_3$.
  * **Safety:** Eye protection must be worn[cite: 564]. The nitrate test produces ammonia gas, which is pungent and harmful, so it should be done in a fume cupboard[cite: 572].

### 9\) Data handling and graphing

  * **Tables of Results:** This chapter relies heavily on interpreting data from tables for qualitative analysis (Tables 14.1-14.6, p. 234-236). Key skills include matching observations (e.g., "light blue precipitate") to the correct ion (e.g., "$Cu^{2+}$").
  * **Chromatograms:** Interpreting a chromatogram involves:
      * Identifying pure substances (one spot) versus mixtures (multiple spots)[cite: 370, 371].
      * Identifying substances by comparing the position of unknown spots with spots of known substances run on the same chromatogram. If two spots travel the same distance, they are likely the same substance[cite: 419, 420].
  * **Graphs:** While not shown, the text mentions that data from a gas collection experiment (volume vs. time) can be plotted to show the rate of reaction[cite: 125, 126]. On such a graph, the volume of gas would be on the y-axis and time on the x-axis.

-----

### 10\) Common misconceptions and exam tips

  * **Misconception:** Any clear liquid is "pure".
      * **Correct understanding:** In chemistry, purity means consisting of only one compound or element. Saltwater is a mixture, not a pure substance, even though it's clear[cite: 436, 439].
      * **Quick tip:** Remember that pure substances have sharp, fixed melting and boiling points.
  * **Misconception:** You can use a pen to draw the baseline in chromatography.
      * **Correct understanding:** Pen ink is a mixture of dyes that will dissolve in the solvent and ruin the experiment. A pencil must be used as graphite is insoluble[cite: 348].
      * **Quick tip:** **P**encil for **P**aper chromatography.
  * **Misconception:** The terms "distillation" and "fractional distillation" are interchangeable.
      * **Correct understanding:** Simple distillation separates a liquid solvent from a dissolved solid. Fractional distillation separates two or more miscible liquids with different boiling points[cite: 237, 285].
      * **Quick tip:** **Fractional** is for separating **fractions** of a liquid mixture (like crude oil).
  * **Exam Tip:** For qualitative analysis questions, always state both the **reagent** you add and the **expected observation**. For example, "Add dilute nitric acid then silver nitrate solution. A white precipitate forms, indicating chloride ions are present."

#### Short-Answer Questions

1.  **Describe how you would obtain a pure, dry sample of sand from a mixture of sand and salty water.**

      * Pour the mixture through a filter funnel containing filter paper[cite: 196].
      * The sand (residue) will be trapped in the filter paper[cite: 198, 199].
      * Wash the sand with distilled water to remove any remaining salt solution.
      * Remove the filter paper, open it flat, and allow the sand to dry in a warm oven.

2.  **Explain why a pencil, not a pen, is used to draw the baseline in paper chromatography.**

      * A pencil mark is made of graphite, which is insoluble in the solvents used[cite: 348].
      * Pen ink is a mixture of soluble dyes which would dissolve in the solvent and separate along with the sample, interfering with the results[cite: 348].

3.  **A student has a solution that could be either zinc nitrate or calcium nitrate. Describe a single chemical test to distinguish between them.**

      * **Test:** Add aqueous ammonia dropwise and then in excess to a sample of the solution[cite: 509].
      * **Result with Zinc Nitrate:** A white precipitate will form that dissolves in excess aqueous ammonia[cite: 509].
      * **Result with Calcium Nitrate:** No precipitate (or a very slight one) will form[cite: 509].

4.  **State two ways to determine if a sample of water is pure.**

      * **Method 1:** Measure its boiling point. Pure water will boil at a sharp, fixed temperature of 100°C[cite: 453].
      * **Method 2:** Measure its freezing/melting point. Pure water will freeze at a sharp, fixed temperature of 0°C[cite: 451].

5.  **Identify the gases described by the following tests:**

      * **(a) Relights a glowing splint:** Oxygen ($O\_2$)[cite: 549].

#### Structured Questions

1.  A student is investigating the dyes in a black food colouring, 'E', using paper chromatography. She places spots of 'E' and three known dyes, red (R), blue (B), and yellow (Y), on a baseline. The final chromatogram is shown below.
    \* **(a) Explain** why the baseline is drawn in pencil and above the solvent level. [2]
    \* **Marking Points:** Pencil is used because it is insoluble and will not run with the solvent [1]. The baseline must be above the solvent so that the spots of dye do not dissolve directly into the solvent at the bottom of the beaker [1].

      * **(b) Identify** the dyes present in the black food colouring 'E'. **Explain** your reasoning. [2]
          * **Marking Points:** 'E' contains blue (B) and yellow (Y) dyes [1]. This is because the spots from 'E' have travelled the same distance up the paper as the spots for B and Y [1].
      * **(c)** The yellow dye (Y) travelled 6.0 cm and the solvent front travelled 8.0 cm from the baseline. **Calculate** the Rƒ value for the yellow dye. [2]
          * **Marking Points:** Formula: $R\_{f} = \\frac{\\text{distance travelled by solute}}{\\text{distance travelled by solvent}}$ [1]. Calculation: $R\_{f} = \\frac{6.0}{8.0} = 0.75$ [1].

2.  A student is given a green crystalline solid, which is known to be a salt containing iron.

      * **(a) Suggest**, based on the colour, which iron ion is likely present. [1]
          * **Marking Point:** Iron(II) / $Fe^{2+}$ ions, as their salts are often pale green crystals[cite: 488].
      * **(b) Describe** the tests and expected results using (i) aqueous sodium hydroxide and (ii) aqueous ammonia to confirm the identity of this ion. [4]
          * **Marking Points:**
          * (i) **Reagent:** Add aqueous sodium hydroxide [1]. **Observation:** A green precipitate forms, which is insoluble in excess and may turn brown at the surface on standing [cite: 502] [1].
          * (ii) **Reagent:** Add aqueous ammonia [1]. **Observation:** A green precipitate forms, which is insoluble in excess and may turn brown at the surface on standing [cite: 509] [1].

### 14\) 60-second recap

This chapter covers the foundations of practical chemistry. You learned to use apparatus like pipettes, burettes, and electronic balances to make accurate measurements of volume and mass. You explored key separation techniques: filtration for insoluble solids, distillation to recover a pure solvent or separate liquids with different boiling points, and chromatography to separate dissolved substances. You learned that pure substances have sharp melting and boiling points, which can be used as a test for purity. Finally, you covered qualitative analysis: using flame tests and precipitation reactions with sodium hydroxide and aqueous ammonia to identify metal cations, and specific chemical tests to identify anions like carbonates, sulfates, and halides, as well as common gases like oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide.

### 1\) Big-picture overview (100–150 words)

This chapter introduces the fundamental building blocks of all matter. You'll learn that everything is made of tiny particles called **atoms** (p. 2) and that a substance made of only one type of atom is an **element** (p. 2). We explore how elements are classified as metals or non-metals based on their properties (p. 2). You'll see how atoms of different elements can chemically bond to form **compounds** (p. 5), which have properties different from their original elements. We'll also look at **mixtures**, where substances are combined without a chemical reaction (p. 9). A key part of the chapter is looking inside the atom itself to understand its structure—a central **nucleus** with protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons in shells (p. 12). This knowledge helps explain why different elements behave the way they do, how **ions** form (p. 14), and what **isotopes** are (p. 15).

### 4\) Core concepts explained

#### **Elements, Metals, and Non-metals (p. 2)**

  * All matter is made of **elements**, which are pure substances consisting of only one type of atom (p. 2).
  * There are 118 identified elements, 98 of which occur naturally (p. 2).
  * Elements can be classified as **metals** or **non-metals** based on their physical properties (p. 2).
  * Chemists use unique one or two-letter symbols for each element, like H for hydrogen and Na for sodium (from its Latin name, *natrium*) (p. 3).

| Property | Metal | Non-metal | Exam note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Appearance** | Shiny (lustrous) | Dull | (p. 2) |
| **State at room temp.** | Usually solid (except Mercury) | Solid, liquid, or gas | (p. 2) |
| **Density** | Usually high | Usually low | (p. 2) |
| **Malleability** | Good (can be hammered into shape) | Poor (brittle or soft) | (p. 2) |
| **Ductility** | Good (can be drawn into wires) | Poor | (p. 2) |
| **Conductivity** | Good (thermal and electrical) | Very poor | (p. 2) |

-----

#### **Molecules (p. 4)**

  * In some elements, atoms join together in small groups called **molecules** (p. 4).
  * **Diatomic molecules** consist of two atoms joined together, such as oxygen ($O\_2$), hydrogen ($H\_2$), and chlorine ($Cl\_2$) (p. 4).
  * Some elements exist as individual, separate atoms and are called **monatomic**, like helium (He) and neon (Ne) (p. 4).
  * Molecules can also be formed from atoms of different elements, like water ($H\_2O$) (p. 5).

-----

#### **Compounds and Chemical Reactions (p. 5)**

  * Compounds are pure substances formed when two or more elements **chemically combine** in fixed proportions (pp. 5, 8).
  * This combination is a **chemical reaction**, which creates a new substance with properties different from the original elements (p. 6).
  * The formula of a compound, like $CO\_2$, shows the symbols and ratio of atoms present (one carbon atom for every two oxygen atoms) (p. 7).
  * **Word equations** show the names of reactants and products: `magnesium + oxygen → magnesium oxide` (p. 6).
  * **Balanced symbol equations** use chemical formulae and show that no atoms are created or destroyed: `$2Mg(s) + O_2(g) \rightarrow 2MgO(s)` (p. 8). The numbers in front are coefficients, and the letters (s, g) are state symbols.

-----

#### **Oxidation and Reduction (p. 6)**

  * **Oxidation** is the **gain** of oxygen by a substance in a reaction (p. 6).
  * **Reduction** is the **loss** of oxygen from a substance in a reaction (p. 6).
  * A reaction that involves both oxidation and reduction is called a **redox reaction** (p. 6).
  * An **oxidising agent** is a substance that oxidises another substance (by giving it oxygen) and gets reduced itself (p. 6).
  * A **reducing agent** is a substance that reduces another substance (by taking its oxygen) and gets oxidised itself (p. 6).

-----

#### **Mixtures (p. 9)**

  * A mixture contains more than one substance (elements or compounds) that are **not chemically bonded** (p. 9).
  * The composition of a mixture can vary (is not fixed) (p. 10).
  * No new chemical substance is formed when a mixture is made (p. 10).
  * The components of a mixture keep their original properties and can be separated by physical means (like using a magnet to separate iron from sulfur) (pp. 9-10).

| Feature | Mixture (Iron + Sulfur) | Compound (Iron(II) Sulfide) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Formation** | No chemical change, just mixing. | Chemical reaction (heating required). |
| **Composition** | Can be in any ratio. | Fixed ratio (1 atom Fe to 1 atom S). |
| **Properties** | Retains properties of both iron and sulfur. | New properties, different from Fe and S. |
| **Separation** | Can be separated by physical means (e.g., magnet). | Can only be separated by another chemical reaction. |

*Table adapted from pp. 9-10*

-----

#### **Atomic Structure (p. 12)**

  * Atoms are made of three main sub-atomic particles: **protons, neutrons, and electrons** (p. 12).
  * The **nucleus** is the dense, central part of the atom containing protons and neutrons (p. 12).
  * **Electrons** are much smaller particles that move very quickly around the nucleus in specific energy levels called **electron shells** (p. 12).
  * Atoms are electrically **neutral** because they have an equal number of positive protons and negative electrons (p. 12).

| Particle | Relative Mass (amu) | Relative Charge | Location |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Proton (p)** | 1 | +1 | Nucleus |
| **Neutron (n)** | 1 | 0 | Nucleus |
| **Electron (e)** | 1/1837 (negligible) | -1 | Shells |

*Table data from p. 12*

-----

#### **Proton Number, Mass Number, and Isotopes (pp. 12-15)**

  * **Proton Number (Z)**: The number of protons in an atom. It defines the element (e.g., any atom with 6 protons is carbon) (p. 12).
  * **Mass Number (A)**: The total number of protons and neutrons in an atom (p. 13).
  * **Notation**: An element is represented as $^{A}*{Z}X$, where X is the symbol (p. 13). For example, Carbon-12 is $^{12}*{6}C$.
  * **Isotopes**: Atoms of the same element (same number of protons) but with a different number of neutrons (and therefore a different mass number) (p. 15).
  * Isotopes of an element have the **same chemical properties** because they have the same number of electrons and the same electronic configuration (p. 15).

-----

#### **Ions (p. 14)**

  * An **ion** is a charged particle formed when a neutral atom loses or gains electrons (p. 14).
  * **Cations** are **positive ions** formed when an atom **loses** one or more electrons. Metals tend to form cations (e.g., $Na \\rightarrow Na^+ + e^-$) (p. 14).
  * **Anions** are **negative ions** formed when an atom **gains** one or more electrons. Non-metals tend to form anions (e.g., $Cl + e^- \\rightarrow Cl^-$) (p. 14).

-----

#### **Electron Arrangement (p. 17)**

  * Electrons fill shells starting from the one closest to the nucleus (p. 17).
  * The maximum number of electrons in each shell is:
      * First shell: **2** electrons (p. 17).
      * Second shell: **8** electrons (p. 17).
      * Third shell: **8** electrons (before the fourth shell starts to fill) (p. 17).
  * The **electronic configuration** is a shorthand for this arrangement (e.g., Sodium with 11 electrons is 2,8,1) (pp. 17, 18).
  * An element's chemical reactivity is largely determined by the number of electrons in its outermost shell (p. 18).
  * Elements with a full outer shell (like Neon: 2,8 and Argon: 2,8,8) are very stable and unreactive (p. 18).

### 6\) Processes and cycles

**1. Forming a Compound (Iron(II) sulfide)** (p. 10)

1.  **Start:** A physical mixture of iron filings (dark grey powder) and sulfur powder (yellow) is created. They can be separated by a magnet.
2.  **Input:** Heat energy is supplied to start the reaction.
3.  **Process:** A chemical reaction occurs. It is an **exothermic reaction**, meaning it gives out heat energy as new chemical bonds are formed.
4.  **Output:** A new compound, iron(II) sulfide (FeS), is formed. This is a black solid that is not magnetic.
5.  **Word Equation:** `iron + sulfur → iron(II) sulfide` (p. 10).

**2. Forming an Ion (Ionisation)** (p. 14)

  * **Cation formation (e.g., Sodium):**
    1.  A neutral sodium atom (Na) has 11 protons (+) and 11 electrons (-). Its electronic configuration is 2,8,1.
    2.  During a chemical reaction, it loses the single electron from its outer shell to achieve a stable, full outer shell.
    3.  It now has 11 protons (+) but only 10 electrons (-).
    4.  The result is a sodium ion with an overall charge of +1, written as $Na^+$.
  * **Anion formation (e.g., Oxygen):**
    1.  A neutral oxygen atom (O) has 8 protons (+) and 8 electrons (-). Its electronic configuration is 2,6.
    2.  During a chemical reaction, it gains two electrons to achieve a stable, full outer shell of 8.
    3.  It now has 8 protons (+) but 10 electrons (-).
    4.  The result is an oxide ion with an overall charge of -2, written as $O^{2-}$.

### 7\) Formulae and calculations

| Quantity | Formula | Units | Typical values | Worked example (with page ref) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Number of neutrons** | Number of neutrons = Mass number (A) - Proton number (Z) | (none) | 0–146+ | **Find the number of neutrons in $^{24}\_{12}Mg$:** \<br\> Neutrons = 24 - 12 = 12 (p. 13). |
| **Relative Atomic Mass ($A\_r$)** | $A\_r = \\frac{(%\_1 \\times mass\_1) + (%\_2 \\times mass\_2) + ...}{100}$ | amu (atomic mass units) or none | 1.0–250+ | **Find the $A\_r$ of chlorine, which is 75% $^{35}Cl$ and 25% $^{37}Cl$:**\<br\>$A\_r = \\frac{(75 \\times 35) + (25 \\times 37)}{100} = \\frac{2625 + 925}{100} = 35.5$ (p. 16). |

### 8\) Required practicals / experiments

**Heating copper in air** (p. 7)

  * **Aim:** To find out what happens when copper is heated in air.
  * **Apparatus:** Crucible, tongs, Bunsen burner, heatproof mat, tripod, pipe-clay triangle, mass balance.
  * **Method:**
    1.  Measure the mass of an empty crucible.
    2.  Add a piece of copper to the crucible and measure the total mass.
    3.  Place the crucible on the pipe-clay triangle and tripod. Heat it strongly with a Bunsen burner for about two minutes.
    4.  Allow the crucible to cool completely.
    5.  Measure the final mass of the crucible and its contents.
  * **Variables:**
      * **IV:** Presence of heat.
      * **DV:** Change in mass and appearance of the copper.
      * **Controls:** Using the same piece of copper and mass balance throughout.
  * **Safety:** Wear eye protection. Handle hot apparatus with tongs (p. 7).
  * **Sources of error:** Incomplete reaction of copper; loss of solid if heating is too vigorous; measurement errors on the balance.
  * **Improvements:** Placing a lid on the crucible (but lifting it occasionally to allow air in) would prevent any loss of the product. Heating until a constant mass is achieved ensures the reaction is complete.
  * **Expected results:** The copper turns into a black substance (copper(II) oxide) and the total mass increases because oxygen atoms from the air have combined with the copper atoms (p. 7). The word equation is `copper + oxygen → copper(II) oxide`.

-----

### 9\) Data handling and graphing

  * This chapter primarily uses **tables** to present data, such as:
      * **Table 2.1 (p. 2):** Physical data (density, melting/boiling points) for metals and non-metals. You may be asked to identify trends from this data (e.g., metals generally have high melting points).
      * **Table 2.2 (p. 2):** A summary of comparative properties. Exam questions often ask you to use these properties to classify a substance.
      * **Table 2.9 (p. 13):** Shows the number of sub-atomic particles for various elements. You must be able to calculate any missing values.
      * **Table 2.12 (p. 18):** Electronic configurations for the first 20 elements. You should be able to deduce these from the proton number.
  * No graphs are required for analysis in the core content of this chapter.

-----

### 10\) Common misconceptions and exam tips

  * **Misconception:** In a balanced equation like $2H\_2O$, the '2's mean the same thing.
      * **Correct understanding:** The subscript 2 in $H\_2$ means two hydrogen atoms are bonded in one molecule. The coefficient 2 in front means there are two separate water molecules.
      * **Quick tip:** **Sub**scripts are for inside the molecule; **Co**efficients are for counting the molecules. Never change subscripts to balance an equation.
  * **Misconception:** Isotopes are different elements because they have different masses.
      * **Correct understanding:** Isotopes are atoms of the *same* element. The element is defined by the proton number, which is identical for all isotopes of that element.
      * **Quick tip:** **Iso**topes have the **sa**me number of **p**rotons. `iso-p`.
  * **Misconception:** The mass of an atom is just the mass of the protons.
      * **Correct understanding:** The mass is determined by protons **and** neutrons in the nucleus. Electrons have a negligible mass.
      * **Quick tip:** Mass number is the "massy" particles: protons + neutrons.
  * **Misconception:** When an atom becomes an ion, its nucleus changes.
      * **Correct understanding:** Ionisation only involves the loss or gain of electrons from the outer shells. The number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus remains unchanged.
      * **Quick tip:** Losing negative electrons makes an ion **p**ositive (a **p**ussycat-ion/cation\!). Gaining negative electrons makes an ion negative.

**Short-Answer Questions**

1.  **Define the term *isotope* using the element carbon ($^{12}*{6}C$ and $^{14}*{6}C$) as an example.**

      * **Answer:** Isotopes are atoms of the same element that have the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons (p. 15). For example, both $^{12}C$ and $^{14}C$ have 6 protons, but $^{12}C$ has 6 neutrons while $^{14}C$ has 8 neutrons.

2.  **State two physical properties that can be used to distinguish between the metal zinc and the non-metal sulfur.**

      * **Answer:** 1. Appearance: Zinc is shiny, while sulfur is dull. 2. Electrical conductivity: Zinc is a good conductor, while sulfur is a very poor conductor (p. 2). (Other valid answers: malleability, density, melting point).

3.  **Explain, in terms of sub-atomic particles, why an atom of sodium is electrically neutral.**

      * **Answer:** A sodium atom has 11 protons in its nucleus, each with a +1 charge, giving a total positive charge of +11 (p. 13, Table 2.9). It also has 11 electrons orbiting the nucleus, each with a -1 charge, giving a total negative charge of -11 (p. 12). The positive and negative charges cancel each other out, so the atom has no overall charge (is neutral) (p. 12).

4.  **Write a balanced chemical equation, including state symbols, for the formation of magnesium oxide from magnesium and oxygen.**

      * **Answer:** $2Mg(s) + O\_2(g) \\rightarrow 2MgO(s)$ (p. 8).

| Question | Answer |
| :--- | :--- |
| What is an element? | A pure substance containing only one type of atom (p. 2). |
| What is a compound? | A pure substance made of two or more elements chemically bonded together in a fixed ratio (p. 5). |
| What is the charge of a proton, neutron, and electron? | Proton: +1, Neutron: 0, Electron: -1 (p. 12). |
| What is the mass number (A)? | The total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus (p. 13). |
| What is the proton number (Z)? | The number of protons in the nucleus; it identifies the element (p. 12). |
| What are isotopes? | Atoms of the same element with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons (p. 15). |

### 14\) 60-second recap

This chapter covers the basics of matter. All matter is made of atoms, which contain a central nucleus of positive protons and neutral neutrons. Negative electrons orbit the nucleus in shells. A substance with only one type of atom is an element, like copper. Elements chemically bond to form compounds, like water ($H\_2O$), in fixed ratios. Substances that are just mixed without bonding are called mixtures, like air. We can classify elements as metals (shiny, good conductors) or non-metals (dull, poor conductors). The number of protons defines an element, but the number of neutrons can vary, creating isotopes. Atoms gain or lose electrons to form charged ions. Finally, chemical reactions, like oxidation (gaining oxygen) and reduction (losing oxygen), create new substances.

### 1\) Big-picture overview (100–150 words)

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of acids, bases, and salts, which are crucial categories of chemical compounds. You'll learn how to identify acids and alkalis using indicators and the pH scale (p. 117), and understand the key difference between a strong acid (fully dissociates) and a weak acid (partially dissociates) (p. 118-119). The chapter focuses heavily on the reactions between acids and bases, known as neutralisation, which produce a salt and water (p. 120). It provides detailed, practical methods for preparing both soluble and insoluble salts in the lab, such as titration and precipitation (p. 121-124). Finally, you will explore hydrated salts, which contain 'water of crystallisation' within their crystal structure, and learn how to test for the presence of common ions (p. 124-126).

### 4\) Core concepts explained

#### **8.1 Acids and Alkalis (p. 116)**

  * **Acids** are substances with a pH less than 7 (p. 117). They taste sour (like lemons) but should never be tasted in a lab (p. 117).
  * **Alkalis** are soluble bases with a pH greater than 7 (p. 117, 122). Many cleaning products are alkaline (p. 117).
  * **Indicators** are dyes that change colour to show if a substance is acidic or alkaline (p. 117). Universal indicator shows a spectrum of colours to estimate the pH value (p. 117).
  * **The pH scale** runs from \<0 to 14, with 7 being neutral (like pure water) (p. 117). A pH meter provides a precise digital reading (p. 118).
  * **The Brønsted-Lowry theory** defines an acid as a proton ($H^+$) donor and a base as a proton ($H^+$) acceptor (p. 118). For an acid to act as a donor, a base must be present to accept the proton (p. 118).

| Feature | Strong Acid | Weak Acid | Exam Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dissociation in water** | Complete/full dissociation (p. 118). | Partial/incomplete dissociation (p. 119). | The reversible arrow ($\\rightleftharpoons$) is used for weak acids (p. 119). |
| **$H^+$ concentration** | High concentration of $H^+$ ions (p. 119). | Low concentration of $H^+$ ions (p. 119). | For the same molar concentration. |
| **pH value** | Low pH (e.g., 0-2) (p. 119). | Higher pH (e.g., 3-6) (p. 119). | Still less than 7. |
| **Conductivity** | Good electrical conductor (p. 119). | Poor electrical conductor (p. 119). | Due to the number of mobile ions. |
| **Rate of reaction** | Fast reaction with metals, bases, etc. (p. 119). | Slow reaction with metals, bases, etc. (p. 119). | Rate depends on $H^+$ concentration. |
| **Examples** | $HCl$, $H\_2SO\_4$, $HNO\_3$ (p. 119). | $CH\_3COOH$ (ethanoic acid), Citric acid (p. 119). | Be able to name one of each. |

  * **Concentration vs. Strength:** These are different concepts (p. 119).
      * **Strength** refers to the degree of dissociation of the acid (p. 119). A strong acid is always strong, even when dilute (p. 119).
      * **Concentration** refers to the amount of acid dissolved in a certain volume of water (p. 119). You can have a concentrated weak acid or a dilute strong acid.

#### **8.2 Formation of salts (p. 120)**

  * A **salt** is formed when an acid reacts with a base in a neutralisation reaction (p. 120).
  * The name of the salt has two parts: the first part comes from the metal in the base (e.g., 'sodium' from sodium hydroxide), and the second part comes from the acid (p. 121).
      * Hydrochloric acid → **Chlorides**
      * Sulfuric acid → **Sulfates**
      * Nitric acid → **Nitrates**
      * Ethanoic acid → **Ethanoates**
  * **Solubility rules** are essential for choosing the correct preparation method (p. 120):
      * **Always Soluble:** All sodium, potassium, and ammonium salts; all nitrates (p. 120).
      * **Mostly Soluble:** Chlorides (except lead and silver); Sulfates (except barium, calcium, lead) (p. 120).
      * **Mostly Insoluble:** Carbonates and hydroxides (except sodium, potassium, ammonium) (p. 120).

#### **8.3 & 8.4 Methods of Preparing Salts (p. 121-124)**

| Method | Reactants | Products | Salt Type | Key Steps |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Acid + Metal** | Acid + Excess Metal | Salt + Hydrogen | Soluble | 1. Add excess metal to acid. 2. Filter off unreacted metal. 3. Evaporate water to crystallise. (p. 121) |
| **Acid + Insoluble Base** | Acid + Excess Insoluble Base (oxide/hydroxide) | Salt + Water | Soluble | 1. Add excess base to warm acid. 2. Filter off unreacted base. 3. Evaporate to crystallise. (p. 123) |
| **Acid + Insoluble Carbonate** | Acid + Excess Insoluble Carbonate | Salt + Water + Carbon Dioxide | Soluble | 1. Add excess carbonate to acid. 2. Filter off unreacted carbonate. 3. Evaporate to crystallise. (p. 122) |
| **Acid + Alkali (Titration)** | Acid + Alkali (soluble base) | Salt + Water | Soluble | 1. Titrate with indicator to find end-point. 2. Repeat without indicator. 3. Evaporate to crystallise. (p. 122) |
| **Precipitation** | Soluble Salt A + Soluble Salt B | Insoluble Salt + Soluble Salt | Insoluble | 1. Mix two soluble salt solutions. 2. Filter the precipitate. 3. Wash with distilled water and dry. (p. 124) |

#### **8.6 Water of Crystallisation (p. 126)**

  * Many salts crystallise from a solution with water molecules chemically bonded into the crystal lattice. This is called a **hydrate** (p. 126).
  * The water is called **water of crystallisation** (p. 126). Its formula is shown with a dot, e.g., $CuSO\_4 \\cdot 5H\_2O$.
  * Heating a hydrate drives off the water, leaving the **anhydrous** salt (p. 126). This is often accompanied by a colour change.
  * **Example:** Blue hydrated copper(II) sulfate ($CuSO\_4 \\cdot 5H\_2O$) turns into white anhydrous copper(II) sulfate ($CuSO\_4$) upon heating (p. 126).
  * The reverse reaction can be used as a chemical test for water: adding water to anhydrous copper(II) sulfate turns it blue (p. 127).

### 6\) Processes and cycles

#### **Preparation of a Soluble Salt (e.g., Copper(II) Sulfate) (p. 123)**

This uses the "acid + insoluble base" method.

1.  **Reaction:** Gently warm some dilute sulfuric acid in a beaker. Add excess copper(II) oxide (a black powder) bit by bit, stirring until no more dissolves. This ensures all the acid has reacted (p. 123).
2.  **Filtration:** Filter the hot mixture to remove the unreacted excess copper(II) oxide. The blue solution collected is copper(II) sulfate (p. 123, similar to Fig 8.7).
3.  **Evaporation:** Gently heat the solution in an evaporating dish to boil off about half the water, concentrating the solution (p. 123, similar to Fig 8.8). Test for saturation by dipping a cold glass rod in; crystals should form on it (p. 123).
4.  **Crystallisation:** Leave the saturated solution to cool slowly. As it cools, the solubility decreases and blue crystals of hydrated copper(II) sulfate will form (p. 123).
5.  **Drying:** Filter the crystals from the remaining solution and dry them between sheets of filter paper (p. 123).

<!-- end list -->

  * **Inputs:** Dilute sulfuric acid ($H\_2SO\_4$), Copper(II) oxide ($CuO$).
  * **Outputs:** Copper(II) sulfate ($CuSO\_4$), Water ($H\_2O$).
  * **Word Equation:** Sulfuric acid + Copper(II) oxide → Copper(II) sulfate + Water (p. 123).
  * **Chemical Equation:** $H\_2SO\_4(aq) + CuO(s) \\rightarrow CuSO\_4(aq) + H\_2O(l)$ (p. 123).

#### **Preparation of an Insoluble Salt (e.g., Barium Sulfate) (p. 124)**

This uses the precipitation method.

1.  **Choose Reactants:** Select two soluble salts. One must contain the cation (positive ion) of the desired salt (e.g., Barium from Barium chloride), and the other must contain the anion (negative ion) (e.g., Sulfate from Sodium sulfate) (p. 124).
2.  **Mixing:** Mix the two solutions together in a beaker (p. 124). A solid white precipitate of barium sulfate will form instantly.
3.  **Filtration:** Filter the mixture to separate the solid precipitate from the solution.
4.  **Washing & Drying:** Wash the precipitate on the filter paper with distilled water to remove any impurities from the remaining soluble salt solution. Then, dry the precipitate in a warm oven or between filter paper.

<!-- end list -->

  * **Inputs:** Barium chloride solution ($BaCl\_2$), Sodium sulfate solution ($Na\_2SO\_4$).
  * **Outputs:** Barium sulfate (solid precipitate, $BaSO\_4$), Sodium chloride solution ($NaCl$).
  * **Chemical Equation:** $BaCl\_2(aq) + Na\_2SO\_4(aq) \\rightarrow BaSO\_4(s) + 2NaCl(aq)$ (p. 124).
  * **Ionic Equation:** $Ba^{2+}(aq) + SO\_4^{2-}(aq) \\rightarrow BaSO\_4(s)$ (p. 124).

#### **Qualitative Analysis: Testing for Anions (p. 124-125)**

| Anion | Test Procedure | Positive Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Carbonate ($CO\_3^{2-}$)** | Add a few drops of any dilute acid (e.g., $HCl$). Bubble any gas produced through limewater. | Effervescence (fizzing). Gas turns limewater milky/cloudy (p. 125). |
| **Sulfate ($SO\_4^{2-}$)** | Add a few drops of dilute hydrochloric acid, followed by a few drops of barium chloride solution. | A white precipitate (barium sulfate) forms (p. 124). |
| **Chloride ($Cl^-$)** | Add a few drops of dilute nitric acid, followed by a few drops of silver nitrate solution. | A white precipitate (silver chloride) forms (p. 125). |
| **Bromide ($Br^-$)** | Add dilute nitric acid, then silver nitrate solution. | A cream precipitate (silver bromide) forms (p. 125). |
| **Iodide ($I^-$)** | Add dilute nitric acid, then silver nitrate solution. | A yellow precipitate (silver iodide) forms (p. 125). |
| **Nitrate ($NO\_3^-$)** | Add aqueous sodium hydroxide, then a small piece of aluminium foil, and warm gently. | Pungent gas (ammonia) is produced, which turns damp red litmus paper blue (p. 125). |

| **Titration calculation** | $\\frac{M\_1 V\_1}{n\_1} = \\frac{M\_2 V\_2}{n\_2}$ \<br\> *($M$ is concentration, $V$ is volume, $n$ is the mole ratio from the balanced equation. The book uses 'M' for the mole ratio instead of 'n'*) (p. 130) | Concentration: $mol/dm^3$ \<br\> Volume: $cm^3$ | Acid/alkali concentrations are often 0.1-1.0 $mol/dm^3$.

### 8\) Required practicals / experiments

#### **Preparation of Potassium Nitrate by Titration (p. 128)**

  * **Aim:** To prepare a pure, dry sample of a soluble salt (potassium nitrate) from an acid and an alkali.
  * **Apparatus:** Burette, clamp stand, $25\~cm^3$ pipette, safety filler, conical flask, evaporating basin, Bunsen burner, tripod, gauze (p. 127).
  * **Method:**
    1.  Use a pipette and safety filler to measure exactly $25.0\~cm^3$ of potassium hydroxide solution into a conical flask (p. 128).
    2.  Add 4 drops of thymolphthalein indicator. The solution will turn blue (p. 128).
    3.  Fill a burette with dilute nitric acid, ensuring the jet is full, and record the initial volume (p. 128).
    4.  Slowly add the acid from the burette to the flask, swirling constantly, until the blue colour just disappears. This is the end-point (p. 128). Record the final volume and calculate the volume of acid added.
    5.  Repeat the experiment using the same volumes of acid and alkali but **without the indicator** to get a pure solution of the salt.
    6.  Pour the resulting potassium nitrate solution into an evaporating basin and heat to evaporate about half the water (p. 128).
    7.  Allow the concentrated solution to cool and crystallise. Filter and dry the crystals (p. 128).
  * **Variables:**
      * **Independent Variable (IV):** Volume of nitric acid added.
      * **Dependent Variable (DV):** Colour change of the indicator.
      * **Control Variables:** Concentration of acid and alkali, volume of alkali.
  * **Safety:** Wear eye protection. Indicator can stain (p. 127).
  * **Sources of Error:** Misjudging the end-point colour change; parallax error when reading the burette; not filling the burette jet.
  * **Expected Results:** A specific volume of acid will be required for neutralisation. On cooling the final solution, white crystals of potassium nitrate will form.

### 9\) Data handling and graphing

This chapter primarily uses data from **titration experiments**.

  * **Tables:** Titration results are recorded in a table with columns for Initial Burette Reading ($cm^3$), Final Burette Reading ($cm^3$), and Titre/Volume Added ($cm^3$). A row is used for a rough titration and then several accurate ones.
  * **Choosing Data:** Consistent results (titres that are within $0.10\~cm^3$ of each other) should be used to calculate a mean average (p. 129). Anomalous results (those that are not close to the others) should be ignored.
  * **Calculations:** The mean titre is used in the titration formula ($M\_1V\_1/n\_1 = M\_2V\_2/n\_2$) to calculate an unknown concentration (p. 130).
  * **Typical Exam Prompts:** "Complete the table by calculating the titre for each experiment." "Identify the two best results and calculate the average volume of acid used." "Use your average volume to calculate the concentration of the alkali."

### 10\) Common misconceptions and exam tips

  * **Misconception:** Strong acid means it's a concentrated acid.

      * **Correct Understanding:** **Strength** refers to how much an acid dissociates into ions, while **concentration** refers to how much acid is dissolved in water (p. 119). You can have a dilute strong acid.
      * **Quick Tip:** Think of 'strength' as the *quality* of the acid and 'concentration' as the *quantity*.

  * **Misconception:** All bases are alkalis.

      * **Correct Understanding:** An alkali is a base that is **soluble** in water (p. 122). Many bases, like copper(II) oxide, are insoluble.
      * **Quick Tip:** All alkalis are bases, but not all bases are alkalis.

  * **Misconception:** In precipitation, the solid is just filtered off and is ready.

      * **Correct Understanding:** The precipitate must be **washed with distilled water** after filtering to remove any soluble impurities before it is dried (p. 124).
      * **Quick Tip:** Remember the steps: Mix → Filter → Wash → Dry.

  * **Misconception:** Forgetting state symbols in equations.

      * **Correct Understanding:** State symbols (s), (l), (g), (aq) are crucial, especially for showing a precipitate (s) or dissolved ions (aq).
      * **Quick Tip:** For precipitation, the ionic equation is always: `cation(aq) + anion(aq) → solid_salt(s)`.

#### **Structured Questions**

**Question 1**
A student wants to find the concentration of a solution of sodium hydroxide. She titrates $25.0\~cm^3$ of the sodium hydroxide solution with $0.100\~mol/dm^3$ hydrochloric acid. Her results are shown in the table.

| Titration | Initial burette reading / $cm^3$ | Final burette reading / $cm^3$ | Titre / $cm^3$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 (Rough) | 0.50 | 22.80 | 22.30 |
| 2 | 1.20 | 23.10 | |
| 3 | 23.10 | 44.90 | 21.80 |

a) **Complete** the table by calculating the titre for titration 2. (1 mark)
b) **Identify** the two best results and **calculate** the average titre. (2 marks)
c) The balanced equation is: $HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) \\rightarrow NaCl(aq) + H\_2O(l)$. **Use** your average titre from (b) to **calculate** the concentration of the sodium hydroxide solution in $mol/dm^3$. (3 marks)

  * **Marking Points:**
      * a) Titre 2 = 23.10 - 1.20 = **21.90 $cm^3$** (1).
      * b) Best results are Titration 2 (21.90) and Titration 3 (21.80) as they are concordant (1). Average titre = (21.90 + 21.80) / 2 = **21.85 $cm^3$** (1).
      * c) Moles of HCl = $(21.85 / 1000) \\times 0.100 = 0.002185\~mol$ (1). Mole ratio HCl:NaOH is 1:1, so moles of NaOH = $0.002185\~mol$ (1). Concentration of NaOH = moles / volume in $dm^3$ = $0.002185 / (25.0 / 1000) = \\textbf{0.0874 mol/dm}^3$ (1).

**Question 2**
Salts can be prepared by different methods.
a) **Name** the method used to prepare potassium chloride from potassium hydroxide. **Explain** why an indicator is needed for the first part of the experiment. (2 marks)
b) **Describe** how to prepare zinc chloride crystals starting with zinc carbonate and an acid. (4 marks)
c) **Write** an ionic equation, including state symbols, for the preparation of zinc chloride in (b). (2 marks)

  * **Marking Points:**
      * a) Method is **titration** (1). An indicator is needed because both reactants (acid and alkali) are colourless solutions, so it shows when the neutralisation point (end-point) is reached (1).
      * b) Add excess zinc carbonate to hydrochloric acid (1). Stir and wait for the effervescence to stop (1). Filter to remove the excess unreacted zinc carbonate (1). Evaporate the filtrate until saturated, then cool to form crystals (1).
      * c) $ZnCO\_3(s) + 2H^+(aq) \\rightarrow Zn^{2+}(aq) + H\_2O(l) + CO\_2(g)$ (1 for species, 1 for state symbols).

### 14\) 60-second recap

This chapter covers acids, bases, and salts. Acids are proton donors with a pH below 7, while bases are proton acceptors. Strong acids fully dissociate in water; weak acids only partially. We use indicators to measure pH. Neutralisation is the reaction between an acid and a base, forming a salt and water. There are four ways to make soluble salts: acid plus a metal, insoluble base, or carbonate, or by titration for soluble bases. Insoluble salts are made by precipitation. You must know the solubility rules and the chemical tests for common anions like carbonates, sulfates, and halides. Finally, some salts are hydrated, meaning they contain water of crystallisation, which can be driven off by heating.

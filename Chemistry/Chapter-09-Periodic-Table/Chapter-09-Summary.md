### 1) Big-picture overview

This chapter introduces the **Periodic Table**, the most important tool in chemistry for organizing the elements[cite: 6, 14]. You'll learn how Dmitri Mendeleev first arranged the elements based on their properties and atomic weights, even leaving gaps for undiscovered ones[cite: 19, 21]. The modern table arranges elements by **proton number**[cite: 208]. The chapter explains that an element's position reveals its secrets: its **group** (vertical column) tells you how many electrons are in its outer shell, which determines its chemical properties[cite: 248, 250]. Its **period** (horizontal row) tells you how many electron shells it has[cite: 251]. You will explore the specific properties and reactivity trends of key groups: the reactive **alkali metals** (Group I), the colourful **halogens** (Group VII), and the unreactive **noble gases** (Group 0/VIII)[cite: 11]. Finally, you will learn the characteristic properties of the **transition metals**[cite: 478].

### 4) Core concepts explained

#### **Development of the Periodic Table (p. 134)**

* Chemists began trying to organize elements about 150 years ago[cite: 7].
* In 1869, Russian chemist **Dmitri Mendeleev** created the most successful early version[cite: 17, 26].
* He arranged the 63 known elements in order of increasing **atomic weight**[cite: 19].
* Crucially, he placed elements with similar properties in the same vertical column (group) and left **gaps** for elements he predicted were yet to be discovered[cite: 19, 21].
* His predictions were proven correct when elements like Germanium were discovered, fitting perfectly into the gaps[cite: 27, 29, 30].
* The modern Periodic Table arranges the 118 known elements in order of increasing **proton number**[cite: 208].

---

#### **Electronic Configuration and the Periodic Table (p. 137)**

* An element's **group number** is the same as the number of electrons in its **outer shell** (except for Group 0)[cite: 248]. This is why elements in the same group have similar chemical properties[cite: 250].
* An element's **period number** is the same as the number of **occupied electron shells** in its atoms[cite: 251].
* **Example:** Sodium (Na) has an electronic configuration of 2,8,1[cite: 239].
    * It has **1 outer electron**, so it's in **Group I**[cite: 252].
    * It has electrons in **3 shells**, so it's in **Period 3**[cite: 237].
* As you go across a period, there is a gradual change from **metals** to **non-metals**[cite: 233].
* As you go down a group, the **metallic character increases** because the outer electrons are further from the nucleus, feel less attraction, and are easier to lose[cite: 253, 254, 255].

---

#### **Group I – The Alkali Metals (p. 137-139)**

* This group includes lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs), and francium (Fr)[cite: 257].
* **Physical Properties:** They are soft metals with low densities, have shiny surfaces when freshly cut, and have low melting points[cite: 263, 264, 265, 266, 272].
* **Chemical Properties:**
    * They are very reactive and stored under oil to prevent contact with air or water[cite: 259].
    * They have **one outer electron** which they lose easily to form a +1 ion, achieving a stable noble gas configuration[cite: 295, 296].
    * They react vigorously with water to produce a metal hydroxide (an alkaline solution) and hydrogen gas. Example: $2K(s) + 2H_2O(l) \rightarrow 2KOH(aq) + H_2(g)$[cite: 282, 287].
* **Reactivity Trend:** Reactivity **increases** as you go **down the group**[cite: 293]. The outer electron is further from the nucleus and more easily lost[cite: 327]. Potassium is more reactive than sodium, which is more reactive than lithium[cite: 288].

---

#### **Group VII – The Halogens (p. 141-142)**

* This group includes fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and astatine (At)[cite: 345]. They exist as **diatomic molecules** (e.g., $Cl_2$)[cite: 348].
* **Physical Properties:**
    * They are coloured, with the colour getting darker down the group[cite: 347].
    * The physical state at room temperature changes from gas (chlorine) to liquid (bromine) to solid (iodine)[cite: 350].
* **Chemical Properties:**
    * They have **seven outer electrons** and react by **gaining one electron** to form a stable -1 ion (halide ion)[cite: 387, 388].
    * They react with metals to form ionic metal halides. Example: $2Na(s) + Cl_2(g) \rightarrow 2NaCl(s)$[cite: 290, 292].
    * They react with hydrogen to produce hydrogen halides, which form acidic solutions in water[cite: 352].
* **Reactivity Trend:** Reactivity **decreases** as you go **down the group**[cite: 386]. It is harder for larger atoms (like bromine) to attract an incoming electron because the outer shell is further from the nucleus and shielded by more inner shells[cite: 394, 396, 397].

---

#### **Group 0/VIII – The Noble Gases (p. 145)**

* This group includes helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and radon (Rn)[cite: 455].
* **Properties:**
    * They are colourless, monatomic (exist as single atoms) gases[cite: 458, 459].
    * They are very **unreactive**[cite: 460].
* **Explanation of Unreactivity:** They are unreactive because they have a **full outer shell** of electrons (2 for He, 8 for the others)[cite: 463, 466]. This is a very stable electronic configuration that is difficult to change[cite: 463]. Other elements react in order to achieve this stable configuration[cite: 464].

---

#### **Transition Elements (p. 145, 147)**

* This is the block of metals between Groups II and III, including familiar metals like iron, copper, and zinc[cite: 223, 478].
* **Comparison of Properties:**

| Feature | Group I Metals (e.g., Sodium) | Transition Metals (e.g., Copper) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hardness/Strength** | Soft [cite: 263] | Harder and stronger [cite: 482] |
| **Melting Point** | Low [cite: 272] | High (except mercury) [cite: 484] |
| **Density** | Low [cite: 265] | Much higher [cite: 483] |
| **Reactivity** | Very reactive [cite: 259] | Less reactive [cite: 479] |
| **Coloured Compounds** | Form white solid oxides [cite: 273] | Form brightly coloured compounds [cite: 480] |
| **Catalytic Activity** | No | Yes, as elements and compounds [cite: 486] |
| **Ion Formation** | Form a fixed +1 ion [cite: 296] | Form ions with **variable oxidation numbers** (e.g., $Cu^+$ and $Cu^{2+}$) [cite: 503] |

### 6) Processes and cycles

#### **Reaction of Alkali Metals with Water (p. 139)**

1.  A piece of alkali metal (e.g., potassium) is dropped into water[cite: 282].
2.  The metal reacts vigorously, often fizzing and moving across the surface[cite: 282]. For potassium, the reaction is vigorous enough to ignite the hydrogen gas produced[cite: 288, 269].
3.  **Inputs:** Alkali metal (solid) + Water (liquid)
4.  **Outputs:** Metal hydroxide (aqueous solution) + Hydrogen gas
5.  **Equation:** $Metal(s) + Water(l) \rightarrow Metal~hydroxide(aq) + Hydrogen(g)$
6.  **Example:** $2K(s) + 2H_2O(l) \rightarrow 2KOH(aq) + H_2(g)$ [cite: 287]
7.  The resulting metal hydroxide solution is alkaline[cite: 282].

---

#### **Halogen Displacement Reactions (p. 142)**

1.  A solution of a more reactive halogen (e.g., chlorine water) is added to a solution of a less reactive halide salt (e.g., potassium iodide)[cite: 370].
2.  The more reactive halogen takes the place of (displaces) the less reactive halide ion, turning it back into a halogen element[cite: 371].
3.  The colour of the solution changes, indicating the presence of the newly formed halogen[cite: 439].
4.  **Reactivity Series:** **Chlorine > Bromine > Iodine**[cite: 385].
5.  **Inputs:** More reactive halogen (aqueous) + Less reactive halide salt (aqueous)
6.  **Outputs:** Less reactive halogen (aqueous) + More reactive halide salt (aqueous)
7.  **Example:** Chlorine displaces iodine from potassium iodide.
    * **Word Equation:** chlorine + potassium iodide → potassium chloride + iodine [cite: 375]
    * **Chemical Equation:** $Cl_2(aq) + 2KI(aq) \rightarrow 2KCl(aq) + I_2(aq)$ [cite: 378]

### 7) Formulae and calculations

This chapter focuses on qualitative trends and reaction equations rather than quantitative calculations. Key skills include writing and balancing symbol equations for the reactions studied.

| Reaction Type | General Word Equation | Example Balanced Equation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Alkali Metal + Oxygen** | metal + oxygen → metal oxide | $4Li(s) + O_2(g) \rightarrow 2Li_2O(s)$ [cite: 277] |
| **Alkali Metal + Water** | metal + water → metal hydroxide + hydrogen | $2K(s) + 2H_2O(l) \rightarrow 2KOH(aq) + H_2(g)$ [cite: 287] |
| **Alkali Metal + Halogen** | metal + halogen → metal halide | $2Na(s) + Cl_2(g) \rightarrow 2NaCl(s)$ [cite: 292] |
| **Halogen Displacement** | more reactive halogen + less reactive halide salt → less reactive halogen + more reactive halide salt | $Cl_2(aq) + 2KBr(aq) \rightarrow Br_2(aq) + 2KCl(aq)$ |

### 8) Required practicals / experiments

#### **Halogen Displacement Reactions (p. 144)**

* **Aim:** To determine the order of reactivity for chlorine, bromine, and iodine[cite: 428].
* **Apparatus:** Test tubes, solutions of chlorine water, bromine water, iodine water, sodium chloride, sodium bromide, sodium iodide, organic solvent[cite: 431, 439].
* **Method:**
    1.  Add a solution of one halogen (e.g., chlorine water) to a solution of a different halide salt (e.g., sodium bromide solution) in a test tube[cite: 439].
    2.  Observe any colour change. A colour change indicates a reaction has occurred and the halide has been displaced[cite: 439].
    3.  To make the colours more distinct, add a small amount of organic solvent, stopper, and shake. The halogen colour will be more vivid in the upper organic layer[cite: 430, 432, 433].
    4.  Repeat for all combinations of halogens and halide salts.
* **Variables:**
    * **Independent Variable (IV):** The combination of halogen and halide solution being tested.
    * **Dependent Variable (DV):** Whether a colour change occurs (i.e., whether a reaction happens).
    * **Control Variables:** Concentration of solutions, volume of solutions, temperature.
* **Safety:** Eye protection must be worn[cite: 426]. Halogens are toxic; perform in a well-ventilated area.
* **Sources of Error:** Misinterpreting subtle colour changes. Contamination of solutions.
* **Improvements:** Use a colour chart for comparison to standardize observations.
* **Expected Results:**
    * Chlorine will displace both bromine and iodine.
    * Bromine will displace iodine but not chlorine.
    * Iodine will not displace chlorine or bromine.
    * This shows the reactivity order is **Chlorine > Bromine > Iodine**[cite: 385].

***

### 9) Data handling and graphing

This chapter primarily uses **qualitative data** presented in tables to show trends.

* **Tables of Properties:** Tables 9.1-9.6 show electronic configurations for elements in different groups[cite: 238, 240, 242, 466]. Table 9.4 shows the colour and state of the halogens[cite: 364]. These are used to identify patterns (e.g., all Group I elements have 1 outer electron).
* **Results Tables:** The results from the halogen displacement practical are recorded in a table (p. 144)[cite: 442]. The table shows the combinations tested and the resulting colour changes.
* **Typical Exam Prompts:**
    * "Use the data in the table to predict the properties of francium/astatine."
    * "Explain the trend in reactivity shown in the results."
    * "Complete the table to show the expected result if bromine water is added to sodium chloride solution." (Answer: No reaction/no colour change).

***

### 10) Common misconceptions and exam tips

* **Misconception:** Reactivity *always* increases down a group.
    * **Correct Understanding:** Reactivity increases down the group for **metals** (like Group I) because they lose electrons more easily[cite: 293, 327]. Reactivity decreases down the group for **non-metals** (like Group VII) because they gain electrons less easily[cite: 386, 398].
    * **Quick Tip:** **M**etals **M**ore reactive down. **N**on-metals **N**ot more reactive down.
* **Misconception:** Group 0 elements are called inert gases.
    * **Correct Understanding:** They are now called **noble gases**[cite: 220]. While very unreactive, some compounds of the heavier noble gases (like xenon) have been made[cite: 462].
    * **Quick Tip:** Think "noble" as in they don't mix with other elements, not "inert" as in completely unable to react.
* **Misconception:** Chlorine is a liquid.
    * **Correct Understanding:** At room temperature, chlorine is a pale yellow-green **gas**, bromine is a red-brown **liquid**, and iodine is a grey-black **solid**[cite: 350, 365].
    * **Quick Tip:** Remember the states in order down the group: Gas → Liquid → Solid (GLS).
* **Exam Tip:** When explaining reactivity trends, *always* link it back to the **ease of losing or gaining electrons** due to the distance from the nucleus and electron shielding.

#### **Short-Answer Questions**

1.  **State two physical properties of alkali metals.**
    * They are soft metals[cite: 263].
    * They have low densities / low melting points[cite: 265, 272].
2.  **Explain why chlorine is more reactive than iodine.**
    * Reactivity in halogens is about gaining an electron[cite: 388].
    * Chlorine's outer shell is closer to the nucleus than iodine's[cite: 394].
    * Therefore, the incoming electron is more strongly attracted by the positive nucleus in chlorine, making it more reactive[cite: 395].
3.  **Write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction between lithium and oxygen.**
    * $4Li(s) + O_2(g) \rightarrow 2Li_2O(s)$[cite: 277].
4.  **Describe two properties that are typical of transition metals but not of Group I metals.**
    * Transition metals form coloured compounds, whereas Group I compounds are white[cite: 480, 273].
    * Transition metals have high melting points/densities, whereas Group I metals have low melting points/densities[cite: 483, 484, 265, 272]. (Also accept catalytic activity or variable oxidation states).
5.  **What would you observe when bromine water is added to a solution of potassium iodide?**
    * The solution would turn brown/orange-brown[cite: 442].
    * This is because bromine is more reactive than iodine and displaces it from the solution[cite: 385].

#### **Structured Questions**

    a) **PREDICT** the state and colour of iodine (I), the next halogen in the group. [2]
    b) **EXPLAIN** why all these elements are placed in Group VII. [1]
    c) **WRITE** a balanced chemical equation for the displacement reaction between chlorine and potassium bromide. [2]
    ***Marking Points:***
    * a) State: **Solid** [1]. Colour: **Grey-black** [1][cite: 365].
    * b) They all have **7 electrons** in their outer shell [1][cite: 387].
    * c) $Cl_2(aq) + 2KBr(aq) \rightarrow 2KCl(aq) + Br_2(aq)$ [1 for correct formulae, 1 for balancing].

2.  Sodium is a typical alkali metal in Group I.
    a) **DESCRIBE** what you would see when a small piece of sodium is added to water containing universal indicator. [3]
    b) When sodium reacts, it forms a positive ion, $Na^+$. **DRAW** the electronic structure of a sodium ion. [2]
    c) **COMPARE** the reactivity of sodium with that of potassium, explaining your reasoning in terms of atomic structure. [3]
    ***Marking Points:***

    * b) A central nucleus (labelled Na+ or 11p) [1]. Two electron shells with the configuration **2,8** [1][cite: 307].
    * c) Potassium is **more reactive** than sodium [1][cite: 288]. A potassium atom is larger/has more shells than a sodium atom [1]. Its outer electron is further from the nucleus and so is **lost more easily** [1][cite: 327].

| **What is a Group in the Periodic Table?** | A vertical column. Elements in it have similar chemical properties and the same number of outer electrons[cite: 20, 209]. |
| **What is a Period in the Periodic Table?** | A horizontal row. Elements in it have the same number of occupied electron shells[cite: 20, 251]. |
| **How did Mendeleev arrange his Periodic Table?** | In order of increasing atomic weight, leaving gaps for undiscovered elements[cite: 19, 21]. |
| **How is the modern Periodic Table arranged?** | In order of increasing proton number[cite: 208]. |
| **What are Group I elements called?** | The alkali metals[cite: 217]. |
| **What is the reactivity trend in Group I?** | It increases down the group[cite: 293]. |
| **Why does reactivity increase down Group I?** | Atoms get larger, the outer electron is further from the nucleus and is lost more easily[cite: 327]. |
| **Products of alkali metal + water?** | Metal hydroxide + hydrogen gas[cite: 282]. |
| **What are Group VII elements called?** | The halogens[cite: 219]. |
| **What is the reactivity trend in Group VII?** | It decreases down the group[cite: 386]. |
| **Why does reactivity decrease down Group VII?** | Atoms get larger, making it harder for the nucleus to attract the extra electron needed[cite: 394, 397]. |
| **What happens if chlorine water is added to potassium iodide solution?** | A reaction occurs. The solution turns brown as iodine is displaced. $Cl_2 + 2KI \rightarrow 2KCl + I_2$[cite: 378]. |
| **What are Group 0 elements called?** | The noble gases[cite: 220]. |
| **Why are noble gases unreactive?** | They have a full, stable outer shell of electrons[cite: 463]. |
| **State three properties of transition metals.** | High density, high melting point, form coloured compounds, act as catalysts, have variable oxidation states[cite: 480, 483, 484, 486, 503]. |

### 14) 60-second recap

The Periodic Table organises elements by increasing proton number into vertical groups and horizontal periods. An element's group number tells you its outer electron count, defining its chemical properties, while the period number shows how many electron shells it has. Group I alkali metals are soft, low-density, and highly reactive, with reactivity increasing down the group as atoms lose their single outer electron more easily. Group VII halogens are reactive non-metals that exist as diatomic molecules, with reactivity decreasing down the group as it becomes harder to gain an electron. A more reactive halogen can displace a less reactive one from its salt solution. Group 0 noble gases are unreactive due to their stable, full outer electron shells. Transition metals are hard, dense, form coloured compounds, and act as catalysts.

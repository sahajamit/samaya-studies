### 1\) Big-picture overview

This chapter explains how atoms join together to form the substances all around us. You'll learn about the three main types of chemical bonds: **ionic**, **covalent**, and **metallic**. Ionic bonds form when atoms transfer electrons, creating charged particles (ions) that attract each other, typically between metals and non-metals. Covalent bonds form when non-metal atoms share electrons. Metallic bonds are found in metals, where outer electrons are free to move, holding a lattice of positive ions together. Understanding these bonds is crucial because they determine a substance's properties, such as its melting point, solubility, and whether it can conduct electricity. The chapter also introduces redox reactions—the process of electron loss (oxidation) and gain (reduction)—which are fundamental to ionic bonding.

### 4\) Core concepts explained

#### **3.1 Ionic Bonding (p. 30)**

  * [cite\_start]Ionic bonds form between **metals and non-metals**[cite: 13].
  * The metal atom **loses** its outer shell electrons to form a **positive ion** (cation). [cite\_start]This is **oxidation**[cite: 14, 45].
  * The non-metal atom **gains** these electrons to form a **negative ion** (anion). [cite\_start]This is **reduction**[cite: 14, 46].
  * [cite\_start]Both ions now have a stable, full outer shell of electrons, like a noble gas[cite: 15, 26].
  * [cite\_start]The strong electrostatic force of attraction between these oppositely charged ions is the ionic bond[cite: 56, 59].
  * [cite\_start]In the solid state, ions are arranged in a regular, repeating 3D pattern called a **giant ionic lattice**[cite: 140, 143]. [cite\_start]For example, in NaCl, each Na⁺ is surrounded by 6 Cl⁻ ions, and each Cl⁻ by 6 Na⁺ ions (p. 33 [cite: 144]).

#### **Properties of Ionic Compounds (p. 34)**

| Feature | Property | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **State** | [cite\_start]Solid at room temperature[cite: 151]. | [cite\_start]Strong electrostatic forces in the giant lattice require a lot of energy to overcome[cite: 152, 153]. |
| **Melting/Boiling Points** | [cite\_start]High[cite: 151]. | [cite\_start]A large amount of thermal energy is needed to break down the strong lattice structure[cite: 153]. |
| **Solubility in water** | [cite\_start]Usually soluble[cite: 155]. | [cite\_start]Water molecules can surround the ions, breaking down the lattice[cite: 155, 156]. |
| **Electrical Conductivity** | [cite\_start]**Do not** conduct when solid[cite: 161]. [cite\_start]**Do** conduct when molten or dissolved in water (aqueous)[cite: 158]. | [cite\_start]In the solid state, ions are fixed in the lattice and cannot move[cite: 161]. [cite\_start]When molten or in solution, the ions are free to move and carry charge[cite: 159]. |

#### **Redox and Oxidation Numbers (p. 31, 35–37)**

  * [cite\_start]**Redox** is a reaction involving both **Red**uction and **Ox**idation[cite: 47, 51].
  * [cite\_start]A simple way to remember electron transfer is **OIL RIG**: **O**xidation **I**s **L**oss, **R**eduction **I**s **G**ain (of electrons) (p. 31 [cite: 49, 50]).
  * **Oxidation Number** tracks electron control.
      * [cite\_start]Oxidation is an **increase** in oxidation number (e.g., Fe²⁺ → Fe³⁺ is an increase from +2 to +3)[cite: 230].
      * [cite\_start]Reduction is a **decrease** in oxidation number (e.g., Cl₂ → 2Cl⁻ is a decrease from 0 to -1)[cite: 231].
  * [cite\_start]An **oxidising agent** gets reduced itself (it takes electrons), while a **reducing agent** gets oxidised itself (it gives electrons)[cite: 234, 235].

#### **3.2 Covalent Bonding (p. 38)**

  * [cite\_start]Covalent bonds form between **non-metal atoms**[cite: 304].
  * [cite\_start]Atoms **share** one or more pairs of outer-shell electrons to achieve a stable, full outer shell (like a noble gas)[cite: 303, 305].
  * [cite\_start]A shared pair of electrons forms a strong covalent bond[cite: 286].
  * [cite\_start]**Single bond**: one shared pair of electrons (e.g., H-H in H₂)[cite: 290].
  * [cite\_start]**Double bond**: two shared pairs of electrons (e.g., O=O in O₂)[cite: 446, 461].
  * [cite\_start]**Triple bond**: three shared pairs of electrons (e.g., N≡N in N₂)[cite: 462, 463].

#### **Covalent Structures and Their Properties (p. 43)**

| Feature | Simple Molecular Structure | Giant Covalent Structure |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Structure** | [cite\_start]Made of small, discrete molecules (e.g., H₂O, CO₂, I₂)[cite: 483, 488]. | [cite\_start]A huge network of atoms joined by strong covalent bonds (e.g., diamond, graphite)[cite: 493, 494]. |
| **Bonds** | **Strong** covalent bonds *within* molecules (intramolecular). [cite\_start]**Weak** forces *between* molecules (intermolecular)[cite: 484]. | [cite\_start]**Strong** covalent bonds throughout the entire structure[cite: 493]. |
| **Melting/Boiling Points** | **Low**. [cite\_start]Only a small amount of energy is needed to overcome the weak intermolecular forces[cite: 496, 497]. | **Very high**. [cite\_start]A large amount of energy is needed to break the many strong covalent bonds[cite: 498]. |
| **Conductivity** | **Do not** conduct electricity. [cite\_start]Molecules have no overall charge and there are no free electrons or ions[cite: 500, 501]. | [cite\_start]**Do not** conduct (e.g., diamond), *except for graphite*[cite: 557, 576]. |

#### **Allotropes of Carbon (p. 45–47)**

| Feature | Graphite | Diamond | Exam Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Structure** | [cite\_start]Layers of hexagonal rings[cite: 559]. | [cite\_start]A rigid, tetrahedral lattice[cite: 573, 574]. | You must be able to describe and sketch these structures. |
| **Bonding** | [cite\_start]Each C atom is bonded to **3** others[cite: 560]. | [cite\_start]Each C atom is bonded to **4** others[cite: 573]. | This difference in bonding is the key to their properties. |
| **Properties** | [cite\_start]Soft and slippery (layers slide over each other due to weak forces between them)[cite: 557, 561]. [cite\_start]Conducts electricity (has delocalised electrons between layers)[cite: 557, 563]. | [cite\_start]Very hard (strong covalent bonds throughout)[cite: 557, 575]. [cite\_start]Does not conduct electricity (all outer electrons are used in bonding)[cite: 557, 576]. | Link properties directly to structure. "Graphite is soft because the layers can slide" is a key marking point. |
| **Uses** | [cite\_start]Lubricant, pencil 'leads', electrodes[cite: 571]. | [cite\_start]Jewellery, cutting tools (glass cutters, drill bits)[cite: 571]. | Uses are a direct result of the properties. |

[cite\_start]**Silicon(IV) Oxide ($SiO\_2$)**, found in sand and quartz, has a giant covalent structure similar to diamond, giving it a very high melting point and making it very hard (p. 44[cite: 494, 511], p. [cite\_start]52 [cite: 703]).

#### **3.3 Metallic Bonding (p. 50)**

  * [cite\_start]Describes the bonding in metals[cite: 632].
  * [cite\_start]Metal atoms lose their outer shell electrons, which become **delocalised** (free to move)[cite: 633, 634].
  * [cite\_start]This creates a regular lattice of **positive metal ions**[cite: 635].
  * [cite\_start]The metallic bond is the strong electrostatic attraction between these positive ions and the "sea" of negative delocalised electrons that surrounds them[cite: 637, 638].

#### **Properties of Metals (p. 50)**

  * [cite\_start]**Good electrical conductors**: The delocalised electrons are free to move and carry charge through the structure[cite: 658, 659].
  * [cite\_start]**Malleable and ductile**: When a force is applied, layers of ions can slide over one another without breaking the metallic bond, which reforms in the new positions[cite: 640, 641, 642].
  * [cite\_start]**High melting/boiling points**: A lot of energy is needed to overcome the strong attraction between the positive ions and the electron sea[cite: 645].
  * [cite\_start]**High density**: The ions are packed closely together in a regular lattice[cite: 665].

### 6\) Processes and cycles

#### **Process: Forming an Ionic Bond (e.g., Sodium Chloride)**

1.  [cite\_start]**Approach**: A sodium atom (metal) comes into contact with a chlorine atom (non-metal) during a reaction (p. 30 [cite: 16]).
2.  [cite\_start]**Electron Transfer**: The sodium atom transfers its single outer electron to the chlorine atom (p. 30 [cite: 23]).
3.  **Ion Formation**:
      * [cite\_start]Sodium, having lost an electron, becomes a positive sodium ion (Na⁺)[cite: 30, 34]. [cite\_start]This is oxidation[cite: 45].
      * [cite\_start]Chlorine, having gained an electron, becomes a negative chloride ion (Cl⁻)[cite: 45]. [cite\_start]This is reduction[cite: 46].
4.  [cite\_start]**Electrostatic Attraction**: The oppositely charged Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions are now strongly attracted to each other, forming an ionic bond[cite: 56, 57].

### 7\) Formulae and calculations

#### **Deducing Ionic Formulae**

[cite\_start]To find the formula of an ionic compound, the total positive charge must balance the total negative charge[cite: 193]. You can use the oxidation numbers (valencies) of the ions.

| Quantity | Formula/Method | Units | Typical values | Worked example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Chemical Formula** | 1. Identify ions and their charges (oxidation numbers). \<br\>2. Balance the charges to find the ratio of ions. | n/a | From Table 3.1 (p. 35): \<br\>Mg²⁺, Na⁺, O²⁻, NO₃⁻ | **Find the formula for magnesium nitrate.** \<br\>1. [cite\_start]Ions: Magnesium (Mg²⁺) and Nitrate (NO₃⁻)[cite: 209]. \<br\>2. Charges: Mg is +2, NO₃ is -1. \<br\>3. Balance: We need two -1 charges to balance one +2 charge. So, one Mg²⁺ ion combines with two NO₃⁻ ions. \<br\>4. [cite\_start]Formula: **Mg(NO₃)₂**[cite: 209]. The brackets show that the subscript '2' applies to the entire nitrate ion. |
| **Ratio of Atoms** | Count the atoms of each element in the final chemical formula. | n/a | Simple whole numbers. | [cite\_start]**Find the ratio of atoms in Mg(NO₃)₂.** \<br\>Mg: 1 \<br\>N: 1 × 2 = 2 \<br\>O: 3 × 2 = 6 \<br\>Ratio = **1 Mg : 2 N : 6 O** [cite: 212] |

### 8\) Required practicals / experiments

#### **Testing the Electrical Conductivity of Substances (p. 44–45)**

  * [cite\_start]**Aim**: To investigate whether ionic and covalent compounds conduct electricity when dissolved in water[cite: 524].
  * [cite\_start]**Apparatus**: 6V power supply, wires, a bulb (or ammeter), a beaker, and two inert electrodes (e.g., graphite)[cite: 524, 526, 532].
  * **Method**:
    1.  [cite\_start]Set up the circuit as shown in the diagram, with the electrodes dipped into a beaker[cite: 524].
    2.  [cite\_start]Pour the first test solution (e.g., potassium chloride solution) into the beaker[cite: 525].
    3.  Turn on the power supply and observe whether the bulb lights up. [cite\_start]Record the result[cite: 531].
    4.  Turn off the power, rinse the electrodes and beaker with distilled water, and dry them.
    5.  [cite\_start]Repeat steps 2-4 for each of the other test solutions (e.g., glucose solution, ethanol, pure water)[cite: 525, 531].
  * **Variables**:
      * **Independent Variable (IV)**: The substance dissolved in the water.
      * **Dependent Variable (DV)**: Whether the bulb lights up (a measure of conductivity).
      * **Control Variables**: Voltage of the power supply, concentration of solutions, distance between electrodes.
  * **Safety**: Wear eye protection. [cite\_start]Handle solutions with care, as some can be irritants[cite: 521].
  * **Sources of Error**: Electrodes not cleaned properly between tests, leading to cross-contamination. Inconsistent concentration of solutions.
  * **Improvements**: Use an ammeter for a quantitative reading of current instead of just observing a bulb. Ensure all solutions are the same concentration.
  * **Expected Results**:
      * [cite\_start]**Ionic solutions** (potassium chloride, calcium chloride, copper(II) sulfate) will conduct electricity, and the **bulb will light up**[cite: 531].
      * [cite\_start]**Covalent solutions** (glucose, ethanol) and pure water will not conduct, and the **bulb will not light up**[cite: 531].

### 9\) Data handling and graphing

[cite\_start]This chapter primarily uses **results tables** to display qualitative data, such as in the conductivity experiment (p. 45 [cite: 531]).

  * **Table Interpretation**:
      * The table has columns for the 'Solution', 'Does the bulb light?', 'Does it conduct?', and 'Bonding type'.
      * You are expected to fill in the last two columns based on the observation in the second column.
      * **Trend**: A 'Yes' in the 'Bulb light?' column corresponds to 'Yes' for conductivity and 'Ionic' for bonding. A 'No' corresponds to 'No' for conductivity and 'Covalent' for bonding.
  * **Typical Exam Prompts**:
      * "Copy and complete the table."
      * "Explain the results for potassium chloride solution." (Answer: It is an ionic compound, so in solution, its ions are free to move and carry charge).
      * "Predict the result for solid potassium chloride and explain your answer." (Answer: The bulb would not light because in a solid, the ions are in fixed positions in the lattice and cannot move) [cite\_start][cite: 536, 161].

### 10\) Common misconceptions and exam tips

  * **Misconception**: "Ionic compounds are made of molecules."

      * **Correct Understanding**: Ionic compounds form giant ionic lattices, not separate molecules. The formula NaCl just represents the 1:1 ratio of ions in the lattice.
      * **Tip**: Remember 'lattice' for ionic, 'molecule' for simple covalent.

  * **Misconception**: "Covalent bonds are weak."

      * **Correct Understanding**: The covalent bonds *within* a molecule (intramolecular) are very strong. It is the *intermolecular* forces of attraction *between* the molecules that are weak.
      * **Tip**: To melt ice, you break the weak forces *between* H₂O molecules, not the strong covalent bonds *inside* them.

  * **Misconception**: "Graphite is soft because its covalent bonds are weak."

      * **Correct Understanding**: Graphite's softness comes from the weak forces *between its layers*, allowing them to slide easily. The covalent bonds within the layers are very strong.
      * **Tip**: Think of graphite as a stack of paper. The paper itself is strong (the layers), but the sheets slide over each other easily.

  * **Misconception**: "In a metal, electrons jump from one atom to another."

      * **Correct Understanding**: The outer electrons are delocalised, meaning they don't belong to any single atom but move freely as a 'sea' throughout the entire structure.
      * **Tip**: Visualise the electrons as a fluid flowing around fixed positive ions.

      * *Model Answer:*
        a) Each carbon atom is covalently bonded to **four** other carbon atoms [1], forming a rigid, **tetrahedral** giant lattice [1].
        b) The structure is held together by many **strong covalent bonds** throughout [1], which require a large amount of energy to break [1].
        c) In graphite, each carbon atom is bonded to only **three** others [1]. This leaves one **delocalised electron** per atom which is free to move and carry charge [1]. In diamond, all electrons are used in bonding and are not free.

| Question | Answer |
| :--- | :--- |
| What is an ionic bond? | [cite\_start]The strong electrostatic force of attraction between oppositely charged ions (p. 31 [cite: 59]). |
| How are positive ions formed? | [cite\_start]When a metal atom loses one or more electrons (p. 30 [cite: 14]). |
| What is oxidation? | [cite\_start]The loss of electrons, or an increase in oxidation number (p. 31[cite: 49], p. [cite\_start]36 [cite: 233]). |
| What is reduction? | [cite\_start]The gain of electrons, or a decrease in oxidation number (p. 31[cite: 50], p. [cite\_start]36 [cite: 233]). |
| Why do solid ionic compounds not conduct electricity? | [cite\_start]The ions are held in fixed positions in the lattice and are not free to move (p. 34 [cite: 161]). |
| What is a covalent bond? | [cite\_start]A pair of electrons shared between two non-metal atoms (p. 38 [cite: 286]). |
| Why do simple molecules like methane have low boiling points? | [cite\_start]Because of the weak intermolecular forces between the molecules, which require little energy to overcome (p. 43 [cite: 497]). |
| What is a giant covalent structure? | [cite\_start]A structure containing many hundreds of thousands of atoms joined by strong covalent bonds (p. 43 [cite: 493]). |

| How many other atoms is each carbon atom bonded to in graphite? | [cite\_start]Three (p. 47 [cite: 560]). |
| Why is graphite a good lubricant? | [cite\_start]It has a layered structure, and the weak forces between layers allow them to slide over each other easily (p. 47 [cite: 561]). |
| Why do metals conduct electricity? | [cite\_start]They have delocalised electrons that are free to move through the structure and carry charge (p. 50 [cite: 658, 659]). |
| What does malleable mean? | [cite\_start]It can be hammered or bent into shape (p. 50 [cite: 643]). |
| What does ductile mean? | [cite\_start]It can be pulled into a wire (p. 50 [cite: 644]). |
| What is the formula for magnesium oxide? | [cite\_start]MgO (Mg is 2+, O is 2-) (p. 32 [cite: 79]). |

### 14\) 60-second recap

This chapter covers the three ways atoms bond: ionic, covalent, and metallic. Ionic bonding involves the transfer of electrons from metals to non-metals, creating a strong lattice of oppositely charged ions with high melting points. Covalent bonding involves the sharing of electrons between non-metals, forming either simple molecules with low melting points due to weak intermolecular forces, or giant structures like diamond and graphite which have very high melting points. Diamond is hard because of its rigid 3D lattice, while graphite is soft and conductive due to its layered structure and delocalised electrons. Metallic bonding involves a lattice of positive ions in a 'sea' of mobile electrons, which explains why metals are conductive and malleable. All these bonding types are ways for atoms to achieve a stable, full outer electron shell.

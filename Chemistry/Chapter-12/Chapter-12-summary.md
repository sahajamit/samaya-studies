### 1\) Big‑picture overview (100–150 words)

This chapter introduces **organic chemistry**, the study of carbon compounds. It focuses on **hydrocarbons**, which are molecules made only of carbon and hydrogen. You'll learn about two key families, or **homologous series**: the **alkanes** and the **alkenes**. Alkanes are "saturated" with single bonds, making them quite unreactive, and are mainly used as fuels. Alkenes are "unsaturated" because they have a double bond, which makes them much more reactive. This reactivity allows them to undergo addition reactions to make other useful chemicals and, most importantly, to join together to form long chains called **polymers**. These polymers are the basis of plastics. The chapter concludes by looking at how plastics are made (polymerisation) and the serious environmental problems caused by their disposal.

### 4\) Core concepts explained

#### **Alkanes** (p. 188)

  * Alkanes are a **homologous series** of **saturated hydrocarbons** (p. 188). This means they only contain carbon-carbon **single covalent bonds**.
  * Their names end in **-ane** (e.g., methane, ethane) (p. 190).
  * The general formula for alkanes is **$C\_{n}H\_{2n+2}$** (p. 189).
  * As the number of carbon atoms increases, the boiling points increase due to stronger intermolecular forces (p. 189). The first four alkanes (methane to butane) are gases at room temperature (p. 190).
  * Alkanes are generally **unreactive** but undergo two important reactions: **combustion** and **substitution** (p. 191).

#### **Chemical Reactions of Alkanes** (p. 191)

  * **Combustion:** Alkanes burn easily in a good supply of air (oxygen) to produce carbon dioxide, water, and heat energy. This makes them excellent fuels (p. 191).
      * *Word equation:* methane + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water (p. 191)
      * *Balanced equation:* $CH\_{4}(g) + 2O\_{2}(g) \\rightarrow CO\_{2}(g) + 2H\_{2}O(g)$ (p. 191)
  * **Substitution:** Alkanes react with halogens (like chlorine) in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) light. One hydrogen atom is replaced by a halogen atom (p. 192). This is called a photochemical reaction.
      * *Word equation:* methane + chlorine → chloromethane + hydrogen chloride (p. 192)
      * *Balanced equation:* $CH\_{4}(g) + Cl\_{2}(g) \\rightarrow CH\_{3}Cl(g) + HCl(g)$ (p. 192)

#### **Alkenes** (p. 194)

  * Alkenes are a **homologous series** of **unsaturated hydrocarbons** (p. 194).
  * They are unsaturated because their molecules contain at least one **carbon-carbon double covalent bond** ($C=C$) (p. 194). This double bond is their **functional group**.
  * Their names end in **-ene** (e.g., ethene, propene) (p. 194).
  * The general formula for alkenes is **$C\_{n}H\_{2n}$** (p. 194).
  * The double bond makes alkenes **more reactive** than alkanes (p. 194, 196).

#### **Comparison: Alkanes vs. Alkenes**

| Feature | Alkanes | Alkenes | Exam Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bonding** | C-C single bonds only | At least one C=C double bond | Saturated vs. Unsaturated is a key distinction. |
| **General Formula** | $C\_{n}H\_{2n+2}$ | $C\_{n}H\_{2n}$ | Memorise these formulae. |
| **Reactivity** | Generally unreactive | Reactive | Due to the C=C double bond. |
| **Main Reaction Type** | Combustion, Substitution | Addition | Addition reactions break the double bond. |
| **Test with Bromine Water**| No reaction, colour remains brown/orange | Decolourises bromine water | This is the standard test for unsaturation. |

#### **Chemical Reactions of Alkenes (Addition Reactions)** (p. 196)

  * In an **addition reaction**, the carbon-carbon double bond breaks, and atoms are added to the molecule. Only **one product** is formed (p. 196).
  * **Hydrogenation:** Addition of hydrogen ($H\_{2}$) across the double bond to form an alkane. Requires a nickel catalyst and $200^{\\circ}C$ (p. 196).
      * $C\_{2}H\_{4}(g) + H\_{2}(g) \\rightarrow C\_{2}H\_{6}(g)$ (ethene → ethane) (p. 196)
  * **Hydration:** Addition of steam ($H\_{2}O$) across the double bond to form an alcohol. Requires a phosphoric(V) acid catalyst, $300^{\\circ}C$, and 6000 kPa pressure (p. 196–197).
      * $C\_{2}H\_{4}(g) + H\_{2}O(g) \\rightleftharpoons C\_{2}H\_{5}OH(g)$ (ethene → ethanol) (p. 197)
  * **Halogenation:** Addition of a halogen (e.g., bromine, $Br\_{2}$). This reaction happens at room temperature and is used to test for unsaturation (p. 197).
      * $C\_{2}H\_{4}(g) + Br\_{2}(aq) \\rightarrow C\_{2}H\_{4}Br\_{2}(aq)$ (ethene → dibromoethane) (p. 197)

#### **Polymers** (p. 198)

  * **Polymers** are very large molecules made from many small repeating units called **monomers** (p. 198).
  * **Addition polymerisation** is the process where alkene monomers join together. The double bond in each monomer breaks, allowing them to link up into a long chain (p. 198).
  * The polymer is the only product. The name of the polymer is formed by putting 'poly' in front of the monomer name, e.g., ethene polymerises to form poly(ethene) (p. 198).
  * A **repeat unit** is the part of the polymer chain that comes from one monomer molecule. It is shown in square brackets with 'n' outside to represent a large number (p. 198).

#### **Environmental challenges of plastics** (p. 201)

  * Plastics are useful because they are light, cheap, and unreactive. However, this unreactivity means they are **non-biodegradable** and difficult to dispose of (p. 201).
  * **Landfill:** Takes up space and can release greenhouse gases like methane as they very slowly break down (p. 201).
  * **Incineration (Burning):** Can release energy for heating, but may also produce **toxic gases** if not burned at very high temperatures (p. 201).
  * **Ocean Accumulation:** Non-biodegradable plastics build up in oceans, harming and killing aquatic life (p. 201).
  * **Solutions** include recycling, and developing biodegradable or photodegradable plastics, but these are not yet widespread (p. 201).

### 6\) Processes and cycles

#### **Catalytic Cracking** (p. 195)

  * **Aim:** To break down large, less useful alkane molecules into smaller, more useful alkanes and alkenes, which are in higher demand (p. 195).
  * **Inputs → Outputs:**
      * **Input:** A large alkane molecule (e.g., from the kerosene or fuel oil fraction).
      * **Outputs:** A smaller alkane molecule + one or more alkene molecules (+ possibly hydrogen).
  * **Conditions:** High temperature (e.g., $550^{\\circ}C$) and a catalyst (e.g., aluminium oxide and chromium oxide) (p. 195).
  * **Example Word Equation:** Not explicitly given.
  * **Example Balanced Equation:**
      * $C\_{12}H\_{26}(g) \\rightarrow C\_{8}H\_{18}(g) + C\_{4}H\_{8}(g)$ (dodecane → octane + butene) (p. 195)
      * $C\_{10}H\_{22}(g) \\rightarrow C\_{8}H\_{18}(g) + C\_{2}H\_{4}(g)$ (decane → octane + ethene) - *Note: The text has a typo in this equation ($C\_{10}H\_{22}$ should crack to a $C\_{8}$ alkane and ethene, not be a product). A correct version would be: $C\_{10}H\_{22} \\rightarrow C\_{8}H\_{18} + C\_{2}H\_{4}$.*

#### **Addition Polymerisation of Ethene** (p. 198)

  * **Aim:** To produce the polymer poly(ethene) from the monomer ethene.
  * **Step-by-step sequence:**
    1.  A large number ('n') of ethene monomers are subjected to high temperature and high pressure with a catalyst.
    2.  The double bond ($C=C$) in each ethene molecule breaks open.
    3.  The monomers link together via new single covalent bonds to form a very long saturated chain, the poly(ethene) polymer.
  * **Inputs → Outputs:**
      * **Input:** Ethene monomers ($CH\_{2}=CH\_{2}$).
      * **Output:** Poly(ethene) polymer ($- [CH\_{2}-CH\_{2}]\_n -$).
  * **Conditions:** High temperature, high pressure, catalyst (p. 198).

### 8\) Required practicals / experiments

#### **Test to distinguish between an Alkane and an Alkene** (p. 197)

  * **Aim:** To use aqueous bromine to identify which of two hydrocarbons is saturated (alkane) and which is unsaturated (alkene).
  * **Apparatus:** Test tubes, dropping pipette, stoppers.
  * **Method:**
    1.  Place a small amount of the first hydrocarbon (e.g., hexane) into a test tube.
    2.  Place the same amount of the second hydrocarbon (e.g., hexene) into another test tube.
    3.  Using a dropping pipette, add a few drops of aqueous bromine (which is orange/brown) to each test tube (p. 197, 495).
    4.  Stopper the test tubes and shake them (p. 496).
    5.  Observe any colour change.
  * **Variables:**
      * **IV:** Type of hydrocarbon (alkane vs. alkene).
      * **DV:** Colour change of the bromine water.
      * **Controls:** Volume of hydrocarbon, volume of bromine water added, temperature.
  * **Safety:** Wear eye protection. Hydrocarbons are flammable. Bromine is toxic and corrosive (p. 493).
  * **Expected results:**
      * **Alkane (Hexane):** No reaction. The mixture remains orange/brown (p. 197).
      * **Alkene (Hexene):** An addition reaction occurs. The orange/brown bromine water will be decolourised and turn colourless (p. 197).

### 9\) Data handling and graphing

  * **Tables of Homologous Series:** Table 12.1 (p. 190) and Table 12.2 (p. 194) show data for alkanes and alkenes.

      * **Columns:** Name, Molecular Formula, Melting Point, Boiling Point, State at Room Temp.
      * **Trend to look for:** As the number of carbon atoms (and thus molecular mass) increases down the series, the boiling point generally increases (p. 189). This is because the intermolecular forces of attraction between molecules get stronger.
      * **Typical exam prompts:** "Estimate the boiling point of the next member of the series (e.g., heptane)." You would do this by observing the trend/difference between previous members (p. 190, Q1).

  * **Tables of Petroleum Fractions:** Table 12.3 (p. 196) compares the percentage of fractions available in petroleum versus the percentage demanded by industry.

      * **Trend to look for:** There is a surplus of large-molecule fractions (like fuel oil) and a higher demand for smaller-molecule fractions (like gasoline).
      * **Typical exam prompts:** "Explain why cracking is economically important." The answer is that it converts the surplus large molecules into the more in-demand smaller molecules (p. 195).

### 10\) Common misconceptions and exam tips

  * **Misconception:** "Saturated" means a substance has dissolved as much as it can.

      * **Correct understanding:** In organic chemistry, **saturated** means a hydrocarbon has only C-C single bonds and can't add any more atoms to its carbon chain (p. 188). **Unsaturated** means it has C=C double bonds and *can* add more atoms via an addition reaction (p. 194).
      * **Quick tip:** Saturated = Single bonds.

  * **Misconception:** In polymerisation, the monomer molecules themselves are the 'links' in the chain.

      * **Correct understanding:** The **double bond** in each monomer breaks open to form new single bonds that link the monomer units together. The polymer backbone is a chain of single-bonded carbon atoms (p. 198).
      * **Quick tip:** When drawing a polymer repeat unit, always change the C=C to a C-C and draw 'extension' bonds out of the sides of the square brackets.

  * **Misconception:** Alkanes react with bromine.

      * **Correct understanding:** Alkanes only react with bromine (and other halogens) under specific conditions (UV light). They do **not** react with aqueous bromine in a test tube at room temperature (p. 197). This lack of reaction is the basis of the test for saturation.
      * **Quick tip:** Alk**a**ne = No reaction. Alk**e**ne = Decolourises bromine.

### 13\) Flashcards (ready‑to‑use)

**Q1:** What is a hydrocarbon?
**A1:** A compound containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms (p. 188).

**Q2:** What is the general formula for alkanes?
**A2:** $C\_{n}H\_{2n+2}$ (p. 189).

**Q3:** Are alkanes saturated or unsaturated? Why?
**A3:** Saturated, because they only have carbon-carbon single bonds (p. 188).

**Q4:** What are the products of the complete combustion of methane?
**A4:** Carbon dioxide and water (p. 191).

**Q5:** What condition is needed for methane to react with chlorine?
**A5:** Ultraviolet (UV) light (p. 192).

**Q6:** What is this type of reaction called? (Methane + Chlorine)
**A6:** A substitution reaction (p. 192).

**Q7:** What is the general formula for alkenes?
**A7:** $C\_{n}H\_{2n}$ (p. 194).

**Q8:** Are alkenes saturated or unsaturated? Why?
**A8:** Unsaturated, because they have at least one carbon-carbon double bond (p. 194).

**Q9:** What is the functional group of the alkenes?
**A9:** The $C=C$ double bond (p. 194).

**Q10:** What is cracking?
**A10:** Breaking down large alkanes into smaller, more useful alkanes and alkenes using heat and a catalyst (p. 195).

**Q11:** What is an addition reaction?
**A11:** A reaction where atoms are added across a double bond to form a single product (p. 196).

**Q12:** How can you test for an alkene?
**A12:** Add aqueous bromine. An alkene will decolourise it from brown/orange to colourless (p. 197).

**Q13:** What is a monomer?
**A13:** A small molecule that can be joined together to make a polymer (p. 198).

**Q14:** What is a polymer?
**A14:** A large molecule made from many repeating monomer units (p. 198).

**Q15:** What is addition polymerisation?
**A15:** The process where alkene monomers join together by breaking their double bonds to form a long polymer chain, with no other product formed (p. 198).

**Q16:** Name two environmental problems caused by plastic waste.
**A16:** 1. Accumulation in landfill/oceans because it is non-biodegradable. 2. Production of toxic gases when burned (p. 201).

**Q17:** What are structural isomers?
**A17:** Compounds with the same molecular formula but a different arrangement of atoms (structural formula) (p. 191).

**Q18:** What alcohol is made from the hydration of ethene?
**A18:** Ethanol (p. 196).

**Q19:** What alkane is made from the hydrogenation of ethene?
**A19:** Ethane (p. 196).

**Q20:** Draw the displayed formula of ethene.
**A20:** H₂C=CH₂ (with all bonds shown) (p. 195).

### 14\) 60‑second recap

This chapter covers hydrocarbons, which are compounds of only carbon and hydrogen. The **alkanes** are a **saturated** homologous series with general formula $C\_{n}H\_{2n+2}$. They have single bonds, are unreactive, and are used as fuels (combustion). The **alkenes** are **unsaturated** ($C\_{n}H\_{2n}$) because they have a reactive C=C double bond. This allows them to undergo **addition reactions**. We test for alkenes with bromine water, which they decolourise. We make alkenes by **cracking** large alkanes. The most important reaction of alkenes is **addition polymerisation**, where many **monomers** (like ethene) join to form a **polymer** (like poly(ethene)), which is a plastic. These plastics are non-biodegradable, causing major environmental problems like landfill and ocean pollution.

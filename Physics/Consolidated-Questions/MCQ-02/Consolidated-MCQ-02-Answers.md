Here are the detailed answers and solutions for the advanced numerical questions.

### **Solutions**

1.  **Context**: This problem requires finding the total upward force (the reading on the scale) that supports the person's weight and also provides the net force needed for upward acceleration, using Newton's Second Law.
    [cite_start]**Step 1**: Calculate the person's weight ($W$), which is the downward force. [cite: 546]
    $W = mg = 70~kg \times 9.8~N/kg = 686~N$
    [cite_start]**Step 2**: Calculate the resultant force ($F_{net}$) needed to accelerate the person. [cite: 244]
    $F_{net} = ma = 70~kg \times 2.0~m/s^2 = 140~N$
    **Step 3**: The upward force from the floor ($F_{floor}$) must balance the weight AND provide the resultant force.
    $F_{floor} = W + F_{net} = 686~N + 140~N = 826~N$
    **Final Answer**: The force exerted on the floor of the lift is **826 N**.

2.  **Context**: This is a multi-step problem involving efficiency, power, work, and potential energy.
    [cite_start]**Step 1**: Calculate the useful power output of the motor. [cite: 925]
    $P_{useful} = P_{input} \times \text{efficiency} = 2000~W \times 0.75 = 1500~W$
    [cite_start]**Step 2**: Calculate the total useful work done by the motor in one minute (60 s). [cite: 963]
    $W = P_{useful} \times t = 1500~W \times 60~s = 90,000~J$
    **Step 3**: This work is used to increase the gravitational potential energy of the water. [cite_start]We can find the mass lifted using the potential energy formula. [cite: 549]
    $W = \Delta E_p = mgh$
    $90,000~J = m \times 9.8~N/kg \times 15~m$
    $m = 90,000 / (9.8 \times 15) = 612.2~kg$
    **Final Answer**: The pump can lift a mass of **612.2 kg** of water.

3.  **Context**: This problem requires setting up two scenarios using Newton's Second Law to solve for the unknown frictional force, which is constant in both cases.
    **Step 1**: Set up equations for both scenarios. [cite_start]The resultant force is the pulling force minus friction ($F_{net} = F_{pull} - f_{friction}$). [cite: 256]
    [cite_start]Scenario 1: $F_{net1} = 30~N - f_{friction}$ and $F_{net1} = m \times a_1 = 5~kg \times 2~m/s^2 = 10~N$. [cite: 244]
    [cite_start]Scenario 2: $F_{net2} = 40~N - f_{friction}$ and $F_{net2} = m \times a_2 = 5~kg \times 4~m/s^2 = 20~N$. [cite: 244]
    **Step 2**: Use the equation from Scenario 1 to find the frictional force.
    $10~N = 30~N - f_{friction}$
    $f_{friction} = 30~N - 10~N = 20~N$
    **(Check with Scenario 2)**: $40~N - f_{friction} = 40~N - 20~N = 20~N$. This matches $F_{net2}$, so the answer is correct.
    **Final Answer**: The frictional force is **20 N**.

4.  **Context**: This problem requires the combined gas law, as the pressure, volume, and temperature all change.
    [cite_start]**Formula**: $\frac{p_1V_1}{T_1} = \frac{p_2V_2}{T_2}$ [cite: 1505]
    [cite_start]**Step 1**: List variables and convert temperatures to Kelvin. [cite: 1424]
    $p_1 = 1.0 \times 10^5$ Pa, $V_1 = 50~cm^3$, $T_1 = 20^{\circ}C = 293~K$
    $V_2 = 20~cm^3$, $T_2 = 35^{\circ}C = 308~K$
    **Step 2**: Rearrange the formula to solve for the final pressure, $p_2$.
    $p_2 = \frac{p_1V_1T_2}{T_1V_2}$
    **Step 3**: Substitute the values.
    $p_2 = \frac{(1.0 \times 10^5~\text{Pa}) \times (50~\text{cm}^3) \times (308~\text{K})}{(293~\text{K}) \times (20~\text{cm}^3)} = \frac{1.54 \times 10^8}{5860} = 262,798~\text{Pa}$
    **Final Answer**: The new pressure is approximately **$2.63 \times 10^5$ Pa**.

5.  **Context**: This is a multi-step pressure problem requiring the calculation of total weight (box + liquid) before finding the pressure.
    **Step 1**: Calculate the area of the box's base. Area $A = (0.5~m)^2 = 0.25~m^2$.
    **Step 2**: Calculate the volume of the box. Volume $V = (0.5~m)^3 = 0.125~m^3$.
    **Step 3**: Calculate the mass of the liquid inside. $m_{liquid} = \text{density} \times V = 800~kg/m^3 \times 0.125~m^3 = 100~kg$.
    **Step 4**: Calculate the total mass. $m_{total} = m_{box} + m_{liquid} = 20~kg + 100~kg = 120~kg$.
    **Step 5**: Calculate the total weight (Force). [cite_start]$F = m_{total} \times g = 120~kg \times 9.8~N/kg = 1176~N$. [cite: 546]
    **Step 6**: Calculate the pressure on the floor. [cite_start]$p = F/A = 1176~N / 0.25~m^2 = 4704~Pa$. [cite: 1653]
    **Final Answer**: The total pressure exerted is **4704 Pa**.

6.  **Context**: This question requires finding acceleration from kinematic information first, then using Newton's Second Law. The provided documents do not contain kinematic equations involving distance, so this question is modified to use time. **Modified Question:** A car of mass 1200 kg accelerates uniformly from 10 m/s to 25 m/s in **5 seconds**. Calculate the resultant force.
    **Step 1**: Calculate the acceleration. $a = \frac{\text{change in velocity}}{\text{time}} = \frac{25~m/s - 10~m/s}{5~s} = \frac{15~m/s}{5~s} = 3~m/s^2$.
    [cite_start]**Step 2**: Calculate the resultant force. [cite: 244]
    $F = ma = 1200~kg \times 3~m/s^2 = 3600~N$.
    **Final Answer**: The resultant force is **3600 N**.

7.  **Context**: This power calculation requires carefully determining the work done, which depends only on the *vertical* height climbed.
    **Step 1**: Calculate the total vertical height. The depth of the steps is irrelevant.
    Vertical Height = $20~\text{steps} \times 0.15~m/\text{step} = 3.0~m$.
    [cite_start]**Step 2**: Calculate the work done, which is the gain in gravitational potential energy. [cite: 549]
    Work Done ($W$) = $mgh = (40~kg \times 9.8~N/kg) \times 3.0~m = 1176~J$.
    [cite_start]**Step 3**: Calculate the average power output. [cite: 963]
    Power ($P$) = $W/t = 1176~J / 8~s = 147~W$.
    **Final Answer**: The child's average power output is **147 W**.

8.  **Context**: This problem uses the principle that the volume of an incompressible fluid displaced must be the same on both sides of a hydraulic system.
    **Principle**: Volume displaced = Area × distance moved. So, $V_1 = V_2 \implies a \times d_1 = A \times d_2$.
    **Given**: $a = 5.0~cm^2$, $A = 200~cm^2$, $d_2 = 2~cm$.
    **Step 1**: Rearrange the formula to solve for $d_1$.
    $d_1 = \frac{A \times d_2}{a}$
    **Step 2**: Substitute values.
    $d_1 = \frac{200~cm^2 \times 2~cm}{5.0~cm^2} = 80~cm$.
    **Final Answer**: The small piston must be pushed down **80 cm**.

9.  **Context**: This problem uses the principle of conservation of energy. The boulder's loss in gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.
    [cite_start]**Principle**: $\Delta E_p = \Delta E_k$ [cite: 591]
    [cite_start]**Formula**: $mg\Delta h = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ [cite: 592]
    **Step 1**: The mass 'm' appears on both sides and cancels out. The mass of the mountaineer is irrelevant information. The change in height is $\Delta h = 1800~m$.
    $g\Delta h = \frac{1}{2}v^2$
    **Step 2**: Rearrange to solve for speed, $v$.
    $v^2 = 2g\Delta h$
    $v = \sqrt{2g\Delta h}$
    **Step 3**: Substitute values.
    $v = \sqrt{2 \times 9.8~N/kg \times 1800~m} = \sqrt{35280} = 187.8~m/s$.
    **Final Answer**: The speed of the boulder is **187.8 m/s**.

10. **Context**: For springs connected in series, the total extension is the sum of the individual extensions, and the force is the same on both.
    [cite_start]**Step 1**: Calculate the force (weight) acting on the system. [cite: 546]
    $F = mg = 12~kg \times 9.8~N/kg = 117.6~N$.
    [cite_start]**Step 2**: Calculate the extension of the first spring ($x_1$). [cite: 77]
    $x_1 = F / k_1 = 117.6~N / 400~N/m = 0.294~m$.
    [cite_start]**Step 3**: Calculate the extension of the second spring ($x_2$). [cite: 77]
    $x_2 = F / k_2 = 117.6~N / 600~N/m = 0.196~m$.
    **Step 4**: Find the total extension.
    $x_{total} = x_1 + x_2 = 0.294~m + 0.196~m = 0.49~m$.
    **Final Answer**: The total extension is **0.49 m** (or 49 cm).

11. **Context**: This is a Boyle's Law problem where the trick is to find the pressure at the bottom of the lake.
    **Step 1**: Identify pressures. The pressure at the surface is atmospheric pressure, $p_2 = 1.0 \times 10^5$ Pa.
    [cite_start]**Step 2**: The pressure at the bottom ($p_1$) is atmospheric pressure plus the water pressure. [cite: 1845]
    [cite_start]Water pressure $\Delta p = \rho g h = 1000~kg/m^3 \times 9.8~N/kg \times 40~m = 392,000~Pa$. [cite: 1810]
    $p_1 = p_{atm} + \Delta p = 1.0 \times 10^5~Pa + 392,000~Pa = 492,000~Pa$.
    [cite_start]**Step 3**: Apply Boyle's Law ($p_1V_1 = p_2V_2$) to find the final volume, $V_2$. [cite: 1382]
    $V_2 = \frac{p_1V_1}{p_2} = \frac{492,000~Pa \times 5~cm^3}{1.0 \times 10^5~Pa} = 24.6~cm^3$.
    **Final Answer**: The volume of the bubble at the surface is **24.6 cm³**.

12. **Context**: This problem applies the work-energy principle. The total work done by the engine is transferred into two stores: useful kinetic energy and wasted thermal energy due to friction.
    [cite_start]**Principle**: $W_{engine} = \Delta E_k + W_{friction}$ [cite: 709, 490]
    **Solution**: $\Delta E_k = W_{engine} - W_{friction}$
    $\Delta E_k = (8 \times 10^5~J) - (3 \times 10^5~J) = 5 \times 10^5~J$.
    **Final Answer**: The increase in the car's kinetic energy is **$5 \times 10^5$ J**.

13. **Context**: A pressure calculation that requires converting mass to weight and being careful with units for area.
    [cite_start]**Step 1**: Calculate the force (weight) of the person. [cite: 546]
    $F = mg = 60~kg \times 9.8~N/kg = 588~N$.
    **Step 2**: Calculate the area of the heel in $m^2$. Radius $r = 5~mm = 0.005~m$.
    Area $A = \pi r^2 = \pi \times (0.005~m)^2 = 7.85 \times 10^{-5}~m^2$.
    [cite_start]**Step 3**: Calculate the pressure. [cite: 1653]
    $p = F/A = 588~N / (7.85 \times 10^{-5}~m^2) = 7,486,624~Pa$.
    **Final Answer**: The pressure exerted is approximately **$7.5 \times 10^6$ Pa** (or 7.5 MPa).

14. **Context**: This problem uses the conservation of energy principle. The kinetic energy at the second point is equal to the loss in gravitational potential energy from the start.
    **Step 1**: Calculate the net vertical drop in height.
    $\Delta h = h_{initial} - h_{final} = 45~m - 20~m = 25~m$.
    [cite_start]**Step 2**: The kinetic energy gained ($E_k$) is equal to the potential energy lost ($\Delta E_p$). [cite: 591]
    [cite_start]$E_k = \Delta E_p = mg\Delta h$. [cite: 549]
    **Step 3**: Substitute values.
    $E_k = 800~kg \times 9.8~N/kg \times 25~m = 196,000~J$.
    **Final Answer**: The kinetic energy of the car is **196,000 J** (or 196 kJ).

15. **Context**: This problem uses the Pressure Law, as the volume of the tyre is constant.
    [cite_start]**Formula**: $\frac{p_1}{T_1} = \frac{p_2}{T_2}$ [cite: 1483]
    [cite_start]**Step 1**: Convert temperatures to Kelvin. [cite: 1424]
    $T_1 = 17^{\circ}C + 273 = 290~K$
    $T_2 = 57^{\circ}C + 273 = 330~K$
    **Step 2**: Rearrange to solve for the new pressure, $p_2$.
    $p_2 = \frac{p_1T_2}{T_1}$
    **Step 3**: Substitute values.
    $p_2 = \frac{(3.0 \times 10^5~Pa) \times 330~K}{290~K} = 341,379~Pa$.
    **Final Answer**: The new pressure is approximately **$3.41 \times 10^5$ Pa**.

### **Numerical Questions: Solutions**

1.  [cite_start]**Formula**: $F = ma$ [cite: 1801]
    [cite_start]**Solution**: $F = 1000~kg \times 5~m/s^2 = \textbf{5000 N}$ [cite: 1850]
2.  [cite_start]**Formula**: $p_1V_1 = p_2V_2$ [cite: 601]
    [cite_start]**Solution**: $(1.0 \times 10^5~Pa) \times (90~cm^3) = (3.0 \times 10^5~Pa) \times V_2 \implies V_2 = 30~cm^3$ [cite: 619]
3.  [cite_start]**Formula**: $E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ [cite: 983]
    [cite_start]**Solution**: $E_k = 0.5 \times 2~kg \times (3~m/s)^2 = \textbf{9 J}$ [cite: 1133]
4.  [cite_start]**Formula**: $k = F/x$ [cite: 1634]
    [cite_start]**Solution**: $k = 8~N / 0.04~m = \textbf{200 N/m}$ [cite: 1648]
5.  [cite_start]**Formula**: $p = F/A$ [cite: 19]
    **Solution**: $p = 80~N / 4~m^2 = \textbf{20 Pa}$
6.  [cite_start]**Formula**: $P = W/t$ [cite: 1416]
    [cite_start]**Solution**: $P = 600~J / 15~s = \textbf{40 W}$ [cite: 1427]
7.  [cite_start]**Formula**: $\Delta p = \rho g \Delta h$ [cite: 176]
    [cite_start]**Solution**: $\Delta p = 1000~kg/m^3 \times 9.8~N/kg \times 15~m = \textbf{147,000 Pa}$ (or 147 kPa) [cite: 181]
8.  [cite_start]**Formula**: $\frac{p_1V_1}{T_1} = \frac{p_2V_2}{T_2}$[cite: 724]. [cite_start]Since V is constant, this simplifies to $\frac{p_1}{T_1} = \frac{p_2}{T_2}$[cite: 702].
    [cite_start]**Solution**: Convert temperatures to Kelvin: $T_1 = 27 + 273 = 300~K$[cite: 643]; $T_2 = 127 + 273 = 400~K$.
    $p_2 = p_1 \times (T_2/T_1) = 150~kPa \times (400~K / 300~K) = \textbf{200 kPa}$.
9.  [cite_start]**Formula**: $F = f \times (A/a)$ [cite: 126]
    [cite_start]**Solution**: $F = 50~N \times (2.0~m^2 / 0.1~m^2) = 50~N \times 20 = \textbf{1000 N}$ [cite: 131, 132]
10. [cite_start]**Formula**: $efficiency = \frac{\text{useful energy output}}{\text{total energy input}} \times 100\%$ [cite: 1367]
    [cite_start]**Solution**: $efficiency = (150~MJ / 500~MJ) \times 100\% = \textbf{30%}$ [cite: 1550]

### **Multiple Choice Questions: Answers**

1.  **C**. [cite_start]Gas pressure is caused by particles repeatedly colliding with the container walls. [cite: 461, 797]
2.  **C**. [cite_start]Newton's First Law explains that matter has inertia, which is a built-in opposition to changing its state of motion. [cite: 1742, 1743]
3.  **D**. [cite_start]Pressure is defined as the force per unit area. [cite: 18, 21]
4.  **B**. [cite_start]Wind energy is a renewable source. [cite: 1219, 1238]
5.  **C**. [cite_start]In liquids, the particles are close together but are not in fixed positions and can slide past each other. [cite: 354, 355]
6.  **D**. [cite_start]The force that acts towards the center and keeps a body moving in a circular path is called the centripetal force. [cite: 1931]
7.  **B**. [cite_start]Food and fuels are stores of chemical energy. [cite: 876]
8.  **B**. [cite_start]Hydraulic machines work because liquids are almost incompressible and transmit any applied pressure. [cite: 115]
9.  **C**. [cite_start]When stretched beyond the limit of proportionality, a spring is permanently stretched. [cite: 1599, 1618]
10. **B**. [cite_start]The temperature of -273Â°C is called absolute zero. [cite: 456, 635]

### **Subjective Theory Questions: Answers**

1.  [cite_start]If body A exerts a force on body B, then body B exerts an equal but opposite force on body A. [cite: 1880]
2.  [cite_start]Brownian motion is the random, haphazard motion of microscopic particles (like smoke) suspended in a fluid. [cite: 490] [cite_start]It is caused by collisions with many smaller, fast-moving air or liquid molecules and provides evidence for the kinetic particle model of matter. [cite: 491, 492]
3.  [cite_start]The pressure in a liquid increases with depth. [cite: 64] [cite_start]Therefore, the dam wall must be thicker at its base to withstand the greater pressure from the water at the bottom of the reservoir. [cite: 101]
4.  [cite_start]The principle of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed; it is always conserved. [cite: 937]
5.  [cite_start]A gas is easily compressed because its particles are much further apart, with large spaces between them. [cite: 436] [cite_start]A solid cannot be easily compressed because its particles are already close together and held by strong forces. [cite: 420]
6.  [cite_start]A resultant force is the single force which has the same effect as two or more forces acting together. [cite: 1673]
7.  [cite_start]Power is the rate at which work is done or the rate at which energy is transferred. [cite: 1414, 1415] [cite_start]Its SI unit is the **watt (W)**. [cite: 1424]
8.  [cite_start]Pressure is calculated by force divided by area ($p=F/A$). [cite: 19] [cite_start]A sharp knife has a very small cutting area. [cite: 26] [cite_start]This means that even a small force produces a very large pressure, allowing it to cut easily. [cite: 26]
9.  [cite_start]Efficiency is the percentage of the total energy supplied to a device that is usefully transferred. [cite: 1365] [cite_start]It can never be greater than 100% because energy cannot be created, only transferred. [cite: 937] [cite_start]In any real transfer, some energy is always "wasted" as non-useful energy, usually thermal energy, transferred to the surroundings. [cite: 943]
10. [cite_start]In a solid, particles are arranged **close together** in **fixed positions**, often in a regular pattern. [cite: 400, 401] [cite_start]Each particle **vibrates** about its fixed position. [cite: 401]

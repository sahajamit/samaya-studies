## Answer Key

### **Numerical Questions: Solutions**

1.  **Principle**: Potential Energy Lost = Kinetic Energy Gained ($\Delta E_p = E_k$)
    **Formula**: $mg\Delta h = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
    **Solution**: The mass `m` cancels from both sides. $g\Delta h = \frac{1}{2}v^2 \implies v = \sqrt{2g\Delta h}$.
    $v = \sqrt{2 \times 9.8~N/kg \times 20~m} = \sqrt{392} = \textbf{19.8 m/s}$

2.  **Formula**: $p_1V_1 = p_2V_2$
    **Solution**: $(1.2 \times 10^5~Pa) \times (40~cm^3) = p_2 \times (10~cm^3) \implies p_2 = \frac{1.2 \times 10^5 \times 40}{10} = \textbf{4.8} \times \textbf{10}^{\textbf{5}}\textbf{ Pa}$

3.  **Formula**: $p = F/A$
    **Solution**: $p = 500~N / 2~m^2 = \textbf{250 Pa}$

4.  **Formula**: $a = F/m$
    **Solution**: $a = 30~N / 5~kg = \textbf{6 m/sÂ²}$

5.  **Formula**: $W = Fd$
    **Solution**: $W = 80~N \times 10~m = \textbf{800 J}$

6.  a) **Solution**: Useful Energy = Total Input - Wasted Energy = $100~J - 85~J = \textbf{15 J}$
    b) **Formula**: $efficiency = \frac{\text{useful energy output}}{\text{total energy input}} \times 100\%$
    **Solution**: $efficiency = (15~J / 100~J) \times 100\% = \textbf{15%}$

7.  **Formula**: $\Delta p = \rho g \Delta h$
    **Solution**: $\Delta p = 1000~kg/m^3 \times 9.8~N/kg \times 50~m = \textbf{490,000 Pa}$ (or 490 kPa)

8.  **Formula**: $k = F/x$
    **Solution**: First, convert extension to meters: $6~cm = 0.06~m$.
    $k = 12~N / 0.06~m = \textbf{200 N/m}$

9.  **Formula**: $P = W/t$
    **Solution**: $P = 20,000~J / 4~s = \textbf{5000 W}$ (or 5 kW)

10. **Formula**: $F = f \times (A/a)$
    **Solution**: $F = 200~N \times (2.5~m^2 / 0.1~m^2) = 200~N \times 25 = \textbf{5000 N}$

### **Multiple Choice Questions: Answers**

1.  **C**. Gas particles are far apart and move randomly at high speed.
2.  **C**. An object at rest has balanced forces, so the resultant force is zero.
3.  **B**. The large area reduces the pressure ($p = F/A$), preventing sinking.
4.  **D**. A stretched object stores elastic strain energy.
5.  **C**. Brownian motion is the random movement of microscopic particles caused by collisions with fluid molecules.
6.  **D**. Rearranging $F = ma$ gives $a = F/m$.
7.  **C**. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred from one store to another.
8.  **C**. Pressure in a liquid increases with depth ($p = \rho g h$).
9.  **C**. Hooke's Law describes the direct proportionality between force and extension for an elastic object.
10. **C**. Natural gas is a fossil fuel and is non-renewable.

### **Subjective Theory Questions: Answers**

1.  In a liquid, the particles are close together but are not in fixed positions. They are arranged randomly and can slide past one another, which allows the liquid to flow.
2.  Newton's Second Law states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the resultant force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass ($F=ma$).
3.  A hydraulic system uses an incompressible liquid to transmit pressure. A small force applied to a small area creates a pressure ($p = f/a$), which is transmitted throughout the liquid. This pressure then acts on a larger area, producing a much larger output force ($F = p \times A$).
4.  Power is the rate at which work is done or the rate at which energy is transferred. Its SI unit is the **watt (W)**.
5.  Gas particles are in constant, rapid, and random motion. They repeatedly collide with the walls of their container. The force of these countless collisions over the area of the walls creates pressure.
6.  **Useful**: Friction between car tyres and the road allows the car to accelerate and brake. **Hindrance**: Friction in the moving parts of an engine wastes energy and causes wear.
7.  A Sankey diagram is used to represent energy transfers. The width of each arrow is proportional to the amount of energy it represents, clearly showing how the total input energy is split into useful and wasted energy outputs.
8.  The pressure in a liquid increases with depth ($p = \rho g h$). A dam must be thicker at its base to withstand the much greater force exerted by the water at the bottom of the reservoir.
9.  Boyle's Law states that for a fixed mass of gas at a constant temperature, the pressure is inversely proportional to its volume ($pV = \text{constant}$).
10. **Chemical energy** in the coal is released as **thermal energy** through burning. This thermal energy heats water into high-pressure **steam**. The thermal energy of the steam is converted to **kinetic energy** as it rushes past and turns a turbine. The kinetic energy of the turbine is transferred to a generator, which produces **electrical energy**.

### **Numerical Questions**

1.  
Formula: T(K) = θ(°C) + 273
Solution: T = 25 + 273 = 298 K

2.  
Formula: θ(°C) = T(K) - 273
Solution: θ = 150 - 273 = -123 °C

3.  
Formula: p1V1 = p2V2
Solution: (1 x 10^5 Pa) x (30 cm^3) = (3 x 10^5 Pa) x V2
V2 = (1 x 10^5 x 30) / (3 x 10^5) = 10 cm^3

4.  
Formula: p1V1 = p2V2
Solution: (100 kPa) x (20 cm^3) = p2 x (5 cm^3)
p2 = (100 x 20) / 5 = 400 kPa

5.  
Formula: (p1V1)/T1 = (p2V2)/T2
Step 1: Convert temperatures to Kelvin.
T1 = 27°C + 273 = 300 K
T2 = -23°C + 273 = 250 K
Step 2: Solve for V2.
V2 = (p1V1T2)/(p2T1) = (1.0 atm x 100 m^3 x 250 K) / (0.5 atm x 300 K) = 166.7 m^3

6.  
Formula: p1/T1 = p2/T2
Step 1: Convert initial temperature to Kelvin.
T1 = 17°C + 273 = 290 K
Step 2: Solve for T2 in Kelvin.
T2 = (p2T1)/p1 = ((2.2 x 10^5 Pa) x 290 K) / (2.0 x 10^5 Pa) = 319 K
Step 3: Convert T2 back to Celsius.
θ = 319 - 273 = 46 °C

7.  
Formula: p1/T1 = p2/T2
Solution: p2 = (p1T2)/T1 = (50 kPa x 300 K) / 100 K = 150 kPa

8.  
Formula: V1/T1 = V2/T2
Solution: V2 = (V1T2)/T1 = (2.0 m^3 x 373 K) / 273 K = 2.73 m^3

9.  
Formula: p1V1 = p2V2 (where volume is proportional to length)
Solution: The initial length is 10 cm. The final length is 10 cm + 30 cm = 40 cm.
(1.0 x 10^5 Pa) x (10 cm) = p2 x (40 cm)
p2 = (1.0 x 10^5 x 10) / 40 = 0.25 x 10^5 Pa

10. 
Formula: (p1V1)/T1 = (p2V2)/T2
Step 1: Convert temperatures to Kelvin.
T1 = 27°C + 273 = 300 K
T2 = 0°C + 273 = 273 K
Step 2: Solve for V2. (Note: 100 kPa = 1.0 x 10^5 Pa, so the pressure is constant)
V2 = (p1V1T2)/(p2T1) = (100 kPa x 40 cm^3 x 273 K) / (100 kPa x 300 K) = 36.4 cm^3

### **Subjective Theory Questions**

1. In a solid, the particles are held close together in fixed positions, often in a regular pattern. Each particle vibrates about its fixed position.

2. Brownian motion is the random, haphazard movement of microscopic particles, such as smoke particles suspended in the air. This motion is caused by the particles being struck by many smaller, invisible air molecules. It demonstrates the existence of these constantly moving molecules and provides evidence for the kinetic particle model of matter.

3. A gas is easily compressed because its particles are very far apart, leaving a lot of empty space to push them closer together. A liquid is not easily compressed because its particles are already close together with very little empty space between them.

4. Boyle's Law states that the pressure of a fixed mass of gas is inversely proportional to its volume, provided the temperature is kept constant.

5. Heating a gas increases the average speed and kinetic energy of its particles. In a sealed container, these faster-moving particles will collide with the walls of the container more frequently and with greater force. This increase in the rate and force of collisions results in an increase in the pressure inside the container.

6. The process for the change of state from (a) a liquid to a solid is called solidification. The process for the change of state from (b) a solid to a liquid is called melting.

7. Absolute zero is the lowest possible temperature, which is -273°C or 0 Kelvin. At this temperature, all particle motion ceases, and the particles have no kinetic energy.

8. A particle diagram for a solid would show particles arranged in a tightly packed, regular, and ordered pattern. A diagram for a liquid would show particles close together but in a disordered, random arrangement. A diagram for a gas would show particles far apart with no order, spread throughout the container.

9. A liquid flows and takes the shape of its container because its particles are not held in fixed positions. They are able to move and slide past one another, allowing the liquid as a whole to change its shape.

10. The temperature of a gas is a measure of the average kinetic energy of its particles. As the temperature of the gas increases, the average kinetic energy of its particles also increases.

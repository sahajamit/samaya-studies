`Of course. Here is a quick snapshot of the key formulas and concepts from the chapter on the Kinetic Particle Model of Matter for your revision.

### Key Concepts üìù

* **States of Matter & Particle Arrangement**:
    * [cite_start]**Solids**: Particles are close together and vibrate in **fixed positions** in a regular pattern. [cite: 729, 782] [cite_start]They have a **definite shape and volume**. [cite: 728]
    * [cite_start]**Liquids**: Particles are still close together but can **slide past one another**. [cite: 736] [cite_start]They have a **definite volume** but take the shape of their container. [cite: 734]
    * [cite_start]**Gases**: Particles are **far apart** and move randomly and at **high speed**. [cite: 744, 818] [cite_start]They have **no definite shape or volume**. [cite: 743]

* **Changes of State**:
    * [cite_start]**Melting**: Solid to liquid. [cite: 715]
    * [cite_start]**Boiling/Evaporation**: Liquid to gas. [cite: 716, 741]
    * [cite_start]**Condensation**: Gas to liquid. [cite: 749]
    * [cite_start]**Solidification**: Liquid to solid. [cite: 739]

* [cite_start]**Brownian Motion**: The **random, haphazard motion** of microscopic particles (like smoke) caused by collisions with smaller, invisible molecules (like air). [cite: 871, 873, 874] [cite_start]This is important evidence for the kinetic particle model of matter. [cite: 871]

* [cite_start]**Gas Pressure**: This is caused by the **force from a huge number of gas particles colliding** with the surfaces of their container. [cite: 841, 842, 847]
    * [cite_start]Increasing **temperature** (at constant volume) makes particles move faster, causing more frequent and violent collisions, thus **increasing pressure**. [cite: 918, 919]
    * [cite_start]Decreasing **volume** (at constant temperature) means particles are closer together, so they collide with the walls more often, **increasing pressure**. [cite: 921, 939]

* [cite_start]**Absolute Zero (0 K or -273¬∞C)**: This is the lowest possible temperature, where **particle motion ceases** and a substance has no internal energy. [cite: 836, 837, 1016, 1018]

### Key Formulas ‚ûó

* [cite_start]**Boyle's Law (Constant Temperature)**: The pressure of a fixed mass of gas is inversely proportional to its volume. [cite: 984]
    $p_1V_1 = p_2V_2$
    * **$p$** = pressure (in Pa, atm, etc.)
    * **$V$** = volume (in $m^3$, $cm^3$, etc.)

* [cite_start]**Pressure Law (Constant Volume)**: The pressure of a fixed mass of gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature. [cite: 1087]
    $\frac{p_1}{T_1} = \frac{p_2}{T_2}$

* [cite_start]**Charles' Law (Constant Pressure)**: The volume of a fixed mass of gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature. [cite: 1078]
    $\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2}$

* **Combined Gas Law**:
    $\frac{p_1V_1}{T_1} = \frac{p_2V_2}{T_2}$
    * **$p, V$** = pressure and volume
    * [cite_start]**$T$** = **MUST** be in the absolute temperature scale (Kelvin). [cite: 1106]

* **Temperature Conversion**:
    $T(K) = \theta(^{\circ}C) + 273$
    * **T(K)** = Temperature in Kelvin
    * **$\theta(^{\circ}C)$** = Temperature in Celsius



Here's an explanation of the structure of solids, liquids, and gases in terms of the particle model.

### **Solids**

[cite_start]In solids, the particles are arranged **close together** in **fixed positions**. [cite: 729] [cite_start]They are often organized in a **regular, repeating pattern**, especially in crystalline substances. [cite: 782] [cite_start]The particles are not stationary; each particle **vibrates** about its fixed position. [cite: 782] [cite_start]Strong forces hold the particles together, which is why solids have a **definite shape and volume**. [cite: 728, 800]

***
### **Liquids**

[cite_start]In liquids, the particles are still **close together** but are slightly further apart than in solids. [cite: 735, 789] [cite_start]They are **not held in fixed positions** and are able to move and **slide past one another**. [cite: 736, 790] [cite_start]This allows liquids to flow and take the shape of their container. [cite: 809] [cite_start]The arrangement of particles is less ordered than in a solid. [cite: 735]

### **Gases**

[cite_start]In gases, the particles are **much further apart** from each other than in the other states. [cite: 744, 817] [cite_start]They have **no ordered structure** and move about **freely and randomly** at very high speeds. [cite: 745, 818] [cite_start]Because of the large distances between particles, the forces between them are very small, except during collisions. [cite: 818, 830] [cite_start]This is why gases have **no definite shape or volume**. [cite: 743]

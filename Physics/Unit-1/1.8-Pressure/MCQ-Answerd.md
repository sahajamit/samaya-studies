4.  [cite_start]**Formula**: $\Delta h = \Delta p / (\rho g)$ [cite: 880]
    **Solution**: $\Delta h = (5.0 \times 10^6~Pa) / (1020~kg/m^3 \times 9.8~N/kg) = \textbf{500.2 m}$

5.  [cite_start]**Formula**: $F = f \times (A/a)$ [cite: 830]

6.  [cite_start]**Formula**: $f = F \times (a/A)$ [cite: 830]
    **Solution**: $f = 800~N \times (0.002~m^2 / 0.04~m^2) = 800~N \times 0.05 = \textbf{40 N}$

7.  **Step 1: Find the weight (Force)**. $F = mg = 4000~kg \times 9.8~N/kg = 39,200~N$
    **Step 2: Calculate pressure**. $p = F/A = 39,200~N / 0.8~m^2 = \textbf{49,000 Pa}$ (or 49 kPa)

8.  **Minimum Pressure (largest area)**: Area = $0.3~m \times 0.5~m = 0.15~m^2$. $p = 60~N / 0.15~m^2 = \textbf{400 Pa}$
    **Maximum Pressure (smallest area)**: Area = $0.2~m \times 0.3~m = 0.06~m^2$. $p = 60~N / 0.06~m^2 = \textbf{1000 Pa}$

9.  [cite_start]**Formula**: $p = F/A$ [cite: 723]
    **Solution**: $p = 25~N / 0.1~m^2 = \textbf{250 Pa}$

10. **Step 1: Find the pressure at the base**. [cite_start]$\Delta p = \rho g \Delta h = 1000~kg/m^3 \times 9.8~N/kg \times 5.0~m = 49,000~Pa$ [cite: 880]
    **Step 2: Calculate the force**. [cite_start]$F = p \times A = 49,000~Pa \times 2.5~m^2 = \textbf{122,500 N}$ (or 122.5 kN) [cite: 953]

## Subjective Theory Questions: Answers

1.  [cite_start]Pressure is the force acting per unit area[cite: 722]. [cite_start]The formula is $p = F/A$[cite: 723]. [cite_start]The SI unit is the Pascal (Pa)[cite: 726].

2.  A sharp knife has a very small cutting area. [cite_start]For a given force, this small area results in a very high pressure, which allows it to cut easily[cite: 730]. A blunt knife has a larger area, resulting in lower pressure for the same force.

3.  [cite_start]Pressure in a liquid **increases with depth** [cite: 768][cite_start], and it acts **equally in all directions** at any given depth[cite: 770].

4.  [cite_start]A hydraulic machine uses a liquid to transmit pressure from a small piston to a large piston[cite: 820]. [cite_start]Because the pressure ($p = f/a$) is transmitted equally throughout the liquid, the upward force on the larger piston ($F = p \times A$) is much greater than the initial force, acting as a force multiplier[cite: 831, 832].

5.  [cite_start]Liquids are used in hydraulic systems because they are **almost incompressible**, meaning their volume cannot be easily reduced by squeezing[cite: 819].

6.  Take a can and make holes in its side at different heights. [cite_start]When the can is filled with water, the water will spurt out fastest and furthest from the lowest hole, demonstrating that pressure increases with depth[cite: 769].

7.  [cite_start]The dam must be thicker at the bottom because the water pressure is largest at the bottom and decreases towards the surface[cite: 800, 805]. The thicker base is needed to withstand this large pressure.

8.  [cite_start]**High pressure is useful** for a nail, allowing it to be hammered into wood easily[cite: 730]. [cite_start]**Low pressure is useful** for the wide wheels of a tractor, preventing it from sinking into soft ground[cite: 729].

9.  [cite_start]If the liquid levels were different, the pressure at the bottom of the taller column would be greater than the pressure at the bottom of the shorter column[cite: 777]. [cite_start]The liquid flows from the region of higher pressure to lower pressure until the pressures at the bottom are equal, which occurs when the heights are the same[cite: 778].

10. [cite_start]A Bourdon gauge is a type of pressure gauge used to measure the pressure exerted by a fluid (a liquid or a gas)[cite: 894, 897].

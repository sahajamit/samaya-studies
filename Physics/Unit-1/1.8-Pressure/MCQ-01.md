2.  The pressure on a surface is 500 Pa. If the area of the surface is $0.2~m^2$, what is the force acting on it?
3.  Calculate the pressure at a depth of 20 m below the surface of a lake. The density of water is $1000~kg/m^3$.
4.  A deep-sea submersible is designed to withstand a pressure of $5.0 \times 10^6~Pa$. Calculate the maximum depth it can reach in seawater of density $1020~kg/m^3$.
5.  In a hydraulic lift, a force of 100 N is applied to a small piston of area $0.05~m^2$. If the large piston has an area of $1.0~m^2$, what is the maximum load that can be lifted?
6.  A hydraulic car brake system needs to exert a force of 800 N on the brake pistons, which have a total area of $0.04~m^2$. If the piston in the master cylinder has an area of $0.002~m^2$, calculate the force the driver must apply.
7.  An elephant has a mass of 4000 kg. If the total area of its four feet in contact with the ground is $0.8~m^2$, what is the pressure the elephant exerts on the ground?
8.  A rectangular block weighing 60 N has dimensions of 0.2 m x 0.3 m x 0.5 m. Calculate the maximum and minimum pressure it can exert when resting on a horizontal surface.
9.  A force of 25 N is applied to a piston of area $0.1~m^2$ in a hydraulic jack. Calculate the pressure transmitted through the liquid.
10. A water tank contains water to a depth of 5.0 m. Calculate the force exerted by the water on the base of the tank if the base has an area of $2.5~m^2$. (Density of water = $1000~kg/m^3$)

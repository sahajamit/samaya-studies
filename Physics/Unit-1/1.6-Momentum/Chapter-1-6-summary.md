### **1) Big-Picture Overview**

This chapter introduces the concept of **momentum**, which is a way of describing an object's motion by combining its mass and velocity. It's especially useful for understanding what happens during events like collisions and explosions (p. 55). The core idea is the **principle of conservation of momentum**: in any interaction between objects, the total momentum before the event is the same as the total momentum after, as long as no external forces like friction are involved (p. 56). You'll also learn about **impulse**, which connects force, the time it acts, and the resulting change in momentum. This explains real-world applications like why car crumple zones, airbags, and a cricketer pulling back their hands when catching a ball are all effective at reducing injury by increasing the time of impact to lower the force felt (p. 58).

### **4) Core Concepts Explained**

#### **Momentum (p. 55)**

  * [cite\_start]Momentum is a measure of an object's motion that depends on both its **mass** and its **velocity**[cite: 6].
  * [cite\_start]The formula is **momentum = mass × velocity**, or $p = mv$[cite: 15, 16].
  * [cite\_start]The standard unit for momentum is the **kilogram metre per second (kg m/s)** or the **newton second (Ns)**[cite: 14].
  * [cite\_start]Momentum is a **vector quantity**, meaning it has both magnitude (size) and direction[cite: 87]. The direction of momentum is the same as the direction of the velocity.
  * An object at rest has zero momentum because its velocity is zero.

#### **Conservation of Momentum (p. 56)**

  * [cite\_start]This principle states that when objects interact (e.g., in a collision), their **total momentum remains constant** unless an external force like friction acts on them[cite: 61].
  * In other words: **Total momentum before collision = Total momentum after collision**.
  * This applies to all types of collisions, including those where objects stick together (inelastic) and those where they bounce apart.
  * For a simple collision where object 1 (mass $m\_1$, velocity $u\_1$) hits a stationary object 2 (mass $m\_2$, velocity $u\_2=0$), and they stick together moving with a final velocity $v$, the equation is:
    $m\_1u\_1 + m\_2(0) = (m\_1 + m\_2)v$

#### **Explosions and Recoil (p. 57)**

  * Momentum is also conserved in explosions.
  * [cite\_start]Before the explosion (e.g., firing a rifle), the total momentum is zero because everything is at rest[cite: 91].
  * [cite\_start]During the explosion, the objects move apart, but the total momentum must still be zero[cite: 92].
  * [cite\_start]This means the forward momentum of one part (e.g., the bullet) must be equal in size but opposite in direction to the backward momentum of the other part (e.g., the rifle)[cite: 92].
  * **Momentum of bullet (forward) = Momentum of rifle (backward)**. This backward movement is called **recoil**. [cite\_start]This principle also applies to rockets and jet engines, which gain forward momentum by ejecting hot gases with large backward momentum[cite: 104, 105].

#### **Force, Momentum, and Impulse (p. 57)**

  * A force is required to change an object's momentum.
  * [cite\_start]The **resultant force** is defined as the rate of change of momentum, or $F = \\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta t}$[cite: 135, 136]. [cite\_start]This is another way of stating Newton's second law[cite: 137].
  * [cite\_start]**Impulse** is the change in momentum, calculated as $Impulse = F \\times \\Delta t = \\Delta p$[cite: 131].
  * To produce a certain change in momentum (e.g., stopping a moving car), you can either apply a large force for a short time OR a small force for a long time.
  * Safety features like **crumple zones** in cars, sandpits for long-jumpers, and extensible seat belts work by **increasing the collision time** ($\\Delta t$). [cite\_start]This reduces the average force ($F$) required to bring the momentum to zero, thus reducing injury[cite: 12, 154, 156].

### **5) Diagrams and Micrographs (Figures)**

  * **Figure 1.6.1: Experimental Setup (p. 55)**

      * **What it shows:** A sloping runway with a trolley carrying an 'interrupt card'. Two photogates are positioned along the runway to measure the trolley's velocity before and after a collision.
      * **Labels:** Trolley with 'interrupt card', photogate 1, photogate 2, sloping runway, wires to timer.
      * **To redraw:** Draw a long, slightly tilted rectangle for the runway. Place two U-shaped 'photogates' over the runway. Draw a small rectangular trolley on the runway with a vertical card on top, shown once before photogate 1 and again between the gates.

  * **Figure 1.6.2: Truck Collision (p. 56)**

      * **What it shows:** A two-part diagram illustrating the principle of conservation of momentum.
      * **Part a (Before):** A 60 kg truck moves at 3 m/s towards a stationary 30 kg truck.
      * **Part b (After):** The two trucks are coupled together and move with a common velocity, $v$.

  * **Figure 1.6.3: Deflating Balloon (p. 57)**

      * **What it shows:** A simple demonstration of the principle behind rockets.
      * **Description:** An inflated balloon is shown moving to the right as air rushes out of its open neck to the left. [cite\_start]The forward momentum of the balloon is equal and opposite to the backward momentum of the escaping air[cite: 103].

  * **Figure 1.6.4 & 1.6.5: Sporting Examples of Impulse (p. 58)**

      * **What they show:** How changing the time of impact affects the force.
      * [cite\_start]**Figure 1.6.4a:** A cricketer 'following through' with a bat to increase the contact time, thereby increasing the impulse and the ball's final momentum[cite: 146, 147].
      * **Figure 1.6.4b:** A cricketer drawing their hands back while catching a ball. [cite\_start]This increases the time taken to reduce the ball's momentum to zero, which decreases the force on their hands[cite: 150, 151].
      * **Figure 1.6.5:** A long-jumper landing in sand. [cite\_start]The sand increases the time over which the athlete's momentum is reduced to zero, resulting in a smaller stopping force[cite: 154].

### **6) Processes and Cycles**

#### **Applying Conservation of Momentum in a Collision**

This process is used to find an unknown velocity after a collision.

1.  **Identify the system:** The system consists of the two colliding objects (e.g., trolley 1 and trolley 2).
2.  **Calculate total momentum BEFORE the collision:**
      * Find the momentum of each object individually using $p = mv$. Remember that stationary objects have zero momentum.
      * Add the momenta together, taking direction into account. (For one-dimensional problems, one direction is positive and the opposite is negative).
      * **Equation:** $p\_{total, before} = m\_1u\_1 + m\_2u\_2$
3.  **Calculate total momentum AFTER the collision:**
      * Identify the masses and velocities after the collision. [cite\_start]If the objects stick together, their total mass is $(m\_1 + m\_2)$ and they share a common velocity, $v$[cite: 64].
      * **Equation:** $p\_{total, after} = (m\_1 + m\_2)v$
4.  **Equate the 'before' and 'after' momenta:**
      * [cite\_start]Apply the principle of conservation of momentum: $p\_{total, before} = p\_{total, after}$[cite: 61, 68].
      * **Equation:** $m\_1u\_1 + m\_2u\_2 = (m\_1 + m\_2)v$
5.  **Solve for the unknown:** Rearrange the equation to find the unknown quantity, which is usually the final velocity, $v$.

### **8) Required Practicals / Experiments**

#### **Investigating Conservation of Momentum in Collisions (p. 55-56)**

  * **Aim:** To verify that momentum is conserved in a collision between two trolleys.
  * [cite\_start]**Apparatus:** Sloping runway, two trolleys, two photogates connected to a timer, metre rule, balance, Velcro strips (to make trolleys stick together)[cite: 24, 41].
  * **Method:**
    1.  [cite\_start]Set up the runway with a slight tilt to compensate for friction[cite: 41, 51]. The trolley should roll at a constant velocity.
    2.  Measure the mass of the trolleys ($m\_1$, $m\_2$) and the length of the interrupt card ($l$) on top of trolley 1.
    3.  [cite\_start]Place one trolley ($m\_2$) at rest between the two photogates[cite: 42].
    4.  [cite\_start]Place photogate 1 before the collision point and photogate 2 after it[cite: 26].
    5.  [cite\_start]Push trolley 1 ($m\_1$) from the top of the runway so it passes through photogate 1, collides and sticks to trolley 2, and then the combined mass passes through photogate 2[cite: 42, 43].
    6.  [cite\_start]The timer records the time ($t\_1$) for the card to pass through photogate 1 and the time ($t\_2$) for it to pass through photogate 2[cite: 44].
    7.  [cite\_start]Calculate the velocity before collision ($v\_1 = l/t\_1$) and the velocity after collision ($v\_{1+2} = l/t\_2$)[cite: 25, 44].
    8.  Calculate the momentum before ($p\_{before} = m\_1v\_1$) and momentum after ($p\_{after} = (m\_1+m\_2)v\_{1+2}$).
    9.  Compare $p\_{before}$ and $p\_{after}$. [cite\_start]Repeat for different masses (e.g., stacking trolleys)[cite: 45].
  * **Variables:**
      * **Independent Variable (IV):** The mass of the trolleys involved (e.g., 1 trolley hitting 1, or 2 trolleys hitting 1).
      * **Dependent Variable (DV):** The velocities before and after the collision, used to calculate momentum.
      * **Control Variables:** The length of the interrupt card, the angle of the runway.
  * [cite\_start]**Safety:** Ensure the runway is clear at the bottom and has barriers to prevent trolleys from falling off[cite: 23].
  * **Sources of Error:**
      * Friction is not perfectly compensated for, causing momentum loss.
      * The runway may not be perfectly level or smooth.
      * Measurement error in the length of the interrupt card.
  * [cite\_start]**Improvements:** Use a motion sensor instead of photogates for more detailed velocity data[cite: 38]. Use an air track to minimize friction.
  * [cite\_start]**Expected Results:** The momentum before the collision should be approximately equal to the momentum after the collision, demonstrating conservation of momentum[cite: 50].

-----

### **9) Data Handling and Graphing**

  * **Tables:** The primary method of data handling in this chapter is using tables to organize measurements and calculations from the collision experiment (p. 56).
      * [cite\_start]A 'Before collision' table would have columns for Mass ($m\_1$), Velocity ($v$), and Momentum ($m\_1v$)[cite: 47].
      * [cite\_start]An 'After collision' table would have columns for Total Mass ($m\_1+m\_2$), Velocity ($v\_1$), and Momentum ($(m\_1+m\_2)v\_1$)[cite: 49].
  * **Graphs:** No graphs are explicitly used or plotted in this chapter. However, an exam question could ask you to plot a graph, for example, of force vs. time during an impact. The area under such a graph would represent the impulse (change in momentum).
  * **Exam Prompts:** You will be expected to calculate momentum from given data and fill in the results tables. A common question is to compare the total momentum before and after and comment on whether momentum was conserved, giving reasons for any small discrepancies (e.g., friction).

-----

### **10) Common Misconceptions and Exam Tips**

  * **Misconception:** Momentum and kinetic energy are the same thing.

      * **Correct Understanding:** Momentum ($p=mv$) is a vector, while kinetic energy ($KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$) is a scalar. Momentum is always conserved in collisions (without external forces), but kinetic energy is often lost as heat and sound, unless the collision is perfectly elastic.
      * **Quick Tip:** Remember **V** for **V**elocity and **V**ector. Momentum has direction.

  * **Misconception:** Any object with a large mass has more momentum than a light object.

      * **Correct Understanding:** Momentum depends on *both* mass and velocity. A light object moving very fast can have more momentum than a massive object moving very slowly.
      * **Quick Tip:** Always calculate $p=mv$ before comparing.

  * **Misconception:** Forgetting that momentum is a vector.

      * **Correct Understanding:** In calculations involving objects moving in opposite directions (e.g., recoil), one direction must be treated as positive and the other as negative.
      * **Quick Tip:** In explosion or recoil problems, if the bullet's momentum is $+p$, the gun's momentum is $-p$. The total is still zero.

  * **Exam Tip:** When a question mentions "crumple zones", "airbags", "catching a ball", or "bending knees", the answer must involve **increasing the time of impact** to **decrease the resultant force** for a given change in momentum. Memorize this causal link.

#### **Short-Answer Questions**

1.  **Define** momentum and state its formula. (2 marks)

      * **Answer:** Momentum is the product of an object's mass and velocity [1]. [cite\_start]The formula is $p = mv$ [1][cite: 6, 15].

2.  A girl of mass 50 kg jumps from a stationary boat of mass 300 kg with a horizontal velocity of 3 m/s. **Calculate** the velocity with which the boat moves backwards. (3 marks)

      * **Answer:** Total momentum before = 0 [1]. Forward momentum of girl = $50 \\times 3 = 150$ kg m/s. By conservation of momentum, backward momentum of boat must be 150 kg m/s [1]. [cite\_start]So, $300 \\times v = 150 \\implies v = 150/300 = 0.5$ m/s [1][cite: 123, 124].

3.  A cricketer catches a hard-hit ball. **Explain**, using the concept of impulse, why they pull their hands back during the catch. (3 marks)

      * **Answer:** To stop the ball, its momentum must be changed, which requires an impulse ($F\\Delta t$) [1]. By pulling their hands back, the cricketer increases the time ($\\Delta t$) over which the ball's momentum is reduced to zero [1]. [cite\_start]For the same change in momentum, a larger time results in a smaller average force ($F$), which reduces the sting on the hands [1][cite: 150, 151].

4.  **Calculate** the force required to bring a 1000 kg car from 24 m/s to rest in 1.2 s. (3 marks)

      * **Answer:** Initial momentum $p\_i = 1000 \\times 24 = 24000$ kg m/s. Final momentum $p\_f = 0$ [1]. Change in momentum $\\Delta p = -24000$ kg m/s [1]. Force $F = \\Delta p / \\Delta t = -24000 / 1.2 = -20000$ N [1]. (The negative sign indicates a stopping force) [cite\_start][cite: 167-171].

5.  A 10 kg truck travelling at 5 m/s has a momentum of 50 kg m/s. **Calculate** its momentum if it travels at 36 km/h. (3 marks)

      * **Answer:** First, convert 36 km/h to m/s. $36 \\text{ km/h} = 36000 \\text{ m} / 3600 \\text{ s} = 10$ m/s [2]. [cite\_start]Momentum $p = mv = 10 \\text{ kg} \\times 10 \\text{ m/s} = 100$ kg m/s [1][cite: 111, 117].

    c) **Determine** the common velocity of the trucks immediately after the collision. (3 marks)

      * **Marking Points:**
          * [cite\_start]a) When two or more bodies act on one another, their total momentum remains constant [1], provided no external forces act [1][cite: 61].
          * b) Momentum of A = $500 \\times 4 = 2000$ kg m/s [1]. Momentum of B = $1500 \\times 2 = 3000$ kg m/s [1]. [cite\_start]Total momentum = $2000 + 3000 = 5000$ kg m/s [1][cite: 179].
          * c) Total mass after collision = $500 + 1500 = 2000$ kg [1]. Total momentum after = Total momentum before = 5000 kg m/s [1]. $2000 \\times v = 5000 \\implies v = 5000/2000 = 2.5$ m/s [1].

    b) **Calculate** the impulse of the force. (2 marks)
    c) **Determine** the magnitude of the force. (2 marks)

      * **Marking Points:**
          * a) Initial momentum = $10 \\times 4 = 40$ kg m/s. [cite\_start]Final momentum = $10 \\times 8 = 80$ kg m/s [2][cite: 201, 202, 206].
          * [cite\_start]b) Impulse = change in momentum = $80 - 40 = 40$ Ns [2][cite: 208, 211].

| **How do you calculate force from momentum?** | Force is the rate of change of momentum, $F = \\Delta p / \\Delta t$. (p. 57) |
| **What happens to the total momentum in an explosion?** | It is conserved (remains zero). The forward momentum of one part equals the backward momentum of the other. (p. 57) |
| **Why does a cricketer pull their hands back when catching a ball?** | To increase the time of impact, which reduces the stopping force on their hands. (p. 58) |
| **A 4 kg ball moves at 5 m/s. What is its momentum?** | $p = 4 \\times 5 = 20$ kg m/s. |
| **What is the momentum of a 1000 kg car that is parked?** | Zero, because its velocity is zero. |
| **What is another name for Newton's second law in terms of momentum?** | Resultant force is the rate of change of momentum. (p. 57) |
| **How does a rocket work in the vacuum of space?** | It ejects hot gas with large backward momentum, causing the rocket to gain an equal amount of forward momentum. It doesn't need air to push against. (p. 57) |
| **What is recoil?** | The backward movement experienced by a gun when it is fired, due to the conservation of momentum. (p. 57) |

### **14) 60-Second Recap**

This chapter covers **momentum**, defined as mass times velocity ($p=mv$). The most important rule is the **principle of conservation of momentum**: for any collision or explosion with no external forces, the total momentum before equals the total momentum after. This explains why a rifle recoils and how rockets work. We also learned about **impulse**, which is force multiplied by time, and is equal to the change in momentum. This is key to safety features like crumple zones and airbags, which work by increasing the collision time to reduce the overall force, minimizing injury. You need to be able to solve one-dimensional problems for both collisions where objects stick together and explosions where they fly apart.

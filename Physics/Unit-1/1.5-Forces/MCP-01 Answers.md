### **Answer Key**

#### **Numerical Questions**
1.  $F = kx = 200~N/m \times 0.05~m = \textbf{10 N}$
2.  $k = F/x = 15~N / 0.03~m = \textbf{500 N/m}$
3.  $F = ma = 1200~kg \times 2.5~m/s^2 = \textbf{3000 N}$
4.  $a = F/m = 40~N / 5~kg = \textbf{8 m/sÂ²}$
5.  Resultant Force = $12~N - 4~N = \textbf{8 N}$
6.  First, find acceleration: $a = (v-u)/t = (10~m/s - 0)/4~s = 2.5~m/s^2$. Then, $F = ma = 0.8~kg \times 2.5~m/s^2 = \textbf{2 N}$.
7.  a) If velocity is constant, forces are balanced. Friction = **18 N**.
    b) New Resultant Force = $26~N - 18~N = \textbf{8 N}$.
8.  Resultant Force = $250~N - 215~N = \textbf{35 N}$ in the direction of Person A.
9.  Force = weight = $mg = 0.2~kg \times 9.8~N/kg = 1.96~N$. Then, $k = F/x = 1.96~N / 0.02~m = \textbf{98 N/m}$.
10. A scale drawing would show a right-angled triangle with sides 6 cm (for 30 N) and 8 cm (for 40 N). The hypotenuse (resultant) would measure 10 cm. Resultant force = $10~cm \times 5~N/cm = \textbf{50 N}$. (Calculated using Pythagoras: $\sqrt{30^2 + 40^2} = 50$).

#### **Subjective Theory Questions**
1.  [cite_start]An object stays at rest, or continues to move in a straight line at constant speed, unless acted on by a resultant force. [cite: 174]
2.  [cite_start]The spring constant is the force per unit extension, or the force required to cause an extension of 1 meter. [cite: 74, 75]
3.  [cite_start]A force can change an object's speed or direction of motion, and it can also change its shape or size. [cite: 22, 23]
4.  [cite_start]An object moving in a circle is constantly changing its direction, which means its velocity is changing. [cite: 362] [cite_start]A change in velocity is an acceleration, and according to Newton's laws, an acceleration requires a resultant force (the centripetal force). [cite: 363, 367]
5.  [cite_start]Static friction is the friction that prevents an object from moving when a force is first applied. [cite: 311] [cite_start]Dynamic friction is the friction that acts on an object once it is already moving, and it is typically less than static friction. [cite: 313]
6.  [cite_start]If two forces acting at a point are represented in size and direction by the sides of a parallelogram drawn from the point, their resultant is represented in size and direction by the diagonal of the parallelogram drawn from the point. [cite: 157]
7.  [cite_start]Friction between the soles of our shoes and the ground prevents our feet from slipping backward, allowing us to push off the ground and walk forward. [cite: 300]
8.  [cite_start]The load-extension graph, which was a straight line, becomes non-linear because the extension is no longer proportional to the stretching force. [cite: 83]
9.  [cite_start]A geostationary satellite circles the Earth high above the equator, traveling at the same speed as the Earth rotates so it appears stationary. [cite: 386, 387] [cite_start]Its orbital period is 24 hours. [cite: 387]
10. [cite_start]Newton's Second Law is $F = ma$. [cite: 244] [cite_start]**F** is the resultant force in newtons (N), **m** is the mass of the object in kilograms (kg), and **a** is the acceleration in meters per second squared ($m/s^2$). [cite: 246]

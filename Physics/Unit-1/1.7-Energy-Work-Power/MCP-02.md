## Answer Key

**1. C** (Chemical energy)
**2. B** (Gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy)
**3. B** (energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred)
**4. D** (Zero, because the box does not move)
**5. C** (work is done or energy is transferred)
**6. [cite\_start]D** (16 times larger, because kinetic energy is proportional to the square of the velocity, so $4^2 = 16$) [cite: 132]
**7. C** (Wind)
**8. B** (It has a low energy density and requires large collecting devices)
**9. B** (it transfers a large proportion of input energy to useful stores)
**10. C** (Geothermal)

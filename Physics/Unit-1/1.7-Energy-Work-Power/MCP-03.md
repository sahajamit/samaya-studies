## Answer Key

**1.**
[cite\_start]$E\_k = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ [cite: 130]
$E\_k = 0.5 \\times 0.005\~kg \\times (300\~m/s)^2 = 225\~J$

**2.**
[cite\_start]$\\Delta E\_p = mg\\Delta h$ [cite: 149]
$\\Delta E\_p = 1.5\~kg \\times 9.8\~N/kg \\times 2.0\~m = 29.4\~J$

**3.**
Potential Energy Lost = Kinetic Energy Gained
[cite\_start]$mg\\Delta h = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ [cite: 192]
$0.2 \\times 9.8 \\times 4.0 = 0.5 \\times 0.2 \\times v^2$
$7.84 = 0.1 \\times v^2$
$v^2 = 78.4$
$v = 8.85\~m/s$

**4.**
[cite\_start]Work Done = $\\Delta E\_p = mg\\Delta h$ [cite: 309, 149]
$1960\~J = m \\times 9.8\~N/kg \\times 2.0\~m$
$1960 = m \\times 19.6$
$m = \\frac{1960}{19.6} = 100\~kg$

**5.**
[cite\_start]Power = $\\frac{\\text{Work done}}{\\text{time taken}} = \\frac{mg\\Delta h}{t}$ [cite: 563]
Power = $\\frac{500\~kg \\times 9.8\~N/kg \\times 12\~m}{20\~s} = \\frac{58,800\~J}{20\~s} = 2940\~W$

**6.**
Total Energy Input = Power $\\times$ time = $1500\~W \\times 120\~s = 180,000\~J$
[cite\_start]Efficiency = $\\frac{\\text{useful energy output}}{\\text{total energy input}} \\times 100%$ [cite: 514]
Efficiency = $\\frac{144,000\~J}{180,000\~J} \\times 100% = 80%$

**7.**
$E\_k = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$
$250,000\~J = 0.5 \\times 800\~kg \\times v^2$
$250,000 = 400 \\times v^2$
$v^2 = \\frac{250,000}{400} = 625$
$v = \\sqrt{625} = 25\~m/s$

**8.**
[cite\_start]Work Done = Force $\\times$ distance [cite: 309]
$3000\~J = 50\~N \\times d$
$d = \\frac{3000\~J}{50\~N} = 60\~m$

**9.**
[cite\_start]a) Efficiency = $\\frac{\\text{useful power output}}{\\text{total power input}} \\times 100%$ [cite: 525]
Efficiency = $\\frac{9\~W}{12\~W} \\times 100% = 75%$
b) Power Wasted = Input - Output = $12\~W - 9\~W = 3\~W$. So, **3 J** is wasted every second.

**10.**
a) $E\_k = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$
$E\_k = 0.5 \\times 900\~kg \\times (20\~m/s)^2 = 180,000\~J$
b) Work done by brakes = Initial Kinetic Energy = $F \\times d$
$180,000\~J = F \\times 40\~m$
$F = \\frac{180,000\~J}{40\~m} = 4500\~N$

Of course. Here are the answers and solutions to the practice questions.

## Numerical Questions: Solutions

1.  [cite_start]**Formula**: $E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ [cite: 130]
    **Solution**: $E_k = 0.5 \times 1200~kg \times (20~m/s)^2 = \textbf{240,000 J}$ (or 240 kJ)

2.  [cite_start]**Formula**: $\Delta E_p = mg\Delta h$ [cite: 149]
    **Solution**: $\Delta E_p = 5~kg \times 9.8~N/kg \times 3~m = \textbf{147 J}$

3.  [cite_start]**Principle**: Gravitational potential energy lost equals kinetic energy gained ($\Delta E_p = E_k$). [cite: 191]
    [cite_start]**Solution**: $mg\Delta h = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$[cite: 192]. The mass `m` cancels out.
    $9.8~N/kg \times 30~m = 0.5 \times v^2$
    $294 = 0.5 \times v^2$
    $v^2 = 588$
    $v = \textbf{24.2 m/s}$

4.  [cite_start]**Formula**: $W = Fd$[cite: 309]. Here, the force `F` is the weight of the box.
    **Solution**: $150~J = F \times 1.5~m$
    $F = 150~J / 1.5~m = \textbf{100 N}$

5.  [cite_start]**Step 1: Calculate work done.** $W = Fd = 200~N \times 3~m = 600~J$ [cite: 309]
    [cite_start]**Step 2: Calculate power.** $P = W/t = 600~J / 10~s = \textbf{60 W}$ [cite: 563]

6.  [cite_start]**Formula**: $efficiency = \frac{\text{useful power output}}{\text{total power input}} \times 100\%$ [cite: 525]
    **Solution**: $efficiency = (9~W / 20~W) \times 100\% = \textbf{45%}$

7.  [cite_start]**Formula**: $W = Fd$ [cite: 309]
    **Solution**: $W = 60~N \times 5~m = \textbf{300 J}$

8.  [cite_start]**Formula**: $E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ [cite: 130]
    **Solution**: $200~J = 0.5 \times 1~kg \times v^2$
    $v^2 = 400$
    $v = \textbf{20 m/s}$

9.  [cite_start]**Step 1: Calculate useful energy output (work done).** $W = Fd = 500~N \times 12~m = 6000~J$ [cite: 309]
    [cite_start]**Step 2: Calculate efficiency.** $efficiency = \frac{\text{useful energy output}}{\text{total energy input}} \times 100\% = (6000~J / 8000~J) \times 100\% = \textbf{75%}$ [cite: 514]

10. [cite_start]**Step 1: Calculate work done.** $W = Fd = 600~N \times 10~m = 6000~J$ [cite: 309]
    [cite_start]**Step 2: Calculate power.** $P = W/t = 6000~J / 12~s = \textbf{500 W}$ [cite: 563]

## Subjective Theory Questions: Answers

1.  [cite_start]The principle of conservation of energy states that **energy cannot be created or destroyed**; it is always conserved. [cite: 84]

2.  [cite_start]Power is the **rate at which work is done**, or the rate at which energy is transferred from one store to another. [cite: 561, 562] [cite_start]Its SI unit is the **watt (W)**. [cite: 571]

3.  [cite_start]As the ball falls, its **gravitational potential energy is transferred to kinetic energy**. [cite: 188] [cite_start]When it hits the ground, the kinetic energy is transferred to the surroundings by **heating and by sound waves**. [cite: 92]

4.  [cite_start]**Advantages**: Nuclear fuels do not pollute the atmosphere with carbon dioxide or sulfur dioxide. [cite: 362] [cite_start]**Disadvantages**: They generate radioactive waste that must be stored safely for thousands of years, and there is a risk of accidents leading to dangerous leaks. [cite: 362, 364]

5.  [cite_start]The efficiency of a device is the **percentage of the energy supplied to it that is usefully transferred**. [cite: 512]

6.  [cite_start]Crumple zones at the front and rear of a car are designed to collapse during a collision. [cite: 240] [cite_start]This extends the time of the impact, which reduces the decelerating force and lessens the potential for injury to passengers. [cite: 241]

7.  [cite_start]A **non-renewable** energy source is one that cannot be replaced once used up, like fossil fuels. [cite: 348] [cite_start]A **renewable** energy source is one that cannot be exhausted, like solar or wind energy. [cite: 366]

8.  [cite_start]Energy is stored in fossil fuels as **chemical energy**, which originated from the Sun and was converted by plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. [cite: 351, 352]

9.  [cite_start]In a hydroelectric power station, gravitational potential energy stored in water in a high-level reservoir is released. [cite: 111, 114] [cite_start]The falling water has kinetic energy, which is used to turn a turbine connected to a generator that produces electricity. [cite: 112, 113]

10. [cite_start]Although the total amount of energy is always conserved, transfers often result in the energy being converted into non-useful thermal energy that is spread out and difficult to use. [cite: 90, 93] [cite_start]We need to develop new energy sources to provide a continuous supply of *useful* energy to replace the finite resources we are consuming. [cite: 94]

**Chapter: 4 Biological molecules**
**Book/PDF:** Chapter-4.pdf
**Pages:** 1–21
**Exam level:** Cambridge IGCSE (0610)

### 1\) Big-picture overview (100–150 words)

This chapter introduces the fundamental building blocks of life: biological molecules. You'll learn about the four main types: **carbohydrates**, **fats**, **proteins**, and **DNA**. The key idea is that large, complex molecules (polymers) are built from smaller, repeating sub-units (monomers). For example, carbohydrates like starch are made from glucose units, and proteins are made from amino acids. Understanding their structure is crucial as it determines their function, whether for energy (glucose), energy storage (starch, glycogen, fats), structure (cellulose, proteins), or carrying genetic information (DNA). A major practical part of this chapter is learning the simple biochemical tests used to identify these nutrients in food, a common topic in exams. This knowledge forms the foundation for understanding digestion, respiration, and genetics in later chapters.

### 4\) Core concepts explained

#### Carbohydrates (p. 2)

  * [cite\_start]**Elements:** Composed only of Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O)[cite: 25].
  * [cite\_start]**Monomer:** The basic unit is a simple sugar, or **monosaccharide**, like glucose ($C\_{6}H\_{12}O\_{6}$)[cite: 26, 47]. [cite\_start]Glucose is soluble and often forms a ring structure[cite: 20, 27].
  * **Polymers:** Monomers join to form larger carbohydrates.
      * [cite\_start]**Disaccharides:** Two sugar units, e.g., maltose (soluble)[cite: 38, 47].
      * [cite\_start]**Polysaccharides:** Many sugar units, e.g., starch, glycogen, and cellulose (generally insoluble)[cite: 17, 54].
  * **Functions & Examples:**
      * [cite\_start]**Starch:** An energy storage molecule in **plants**, made of long chains of glucose[cite: 51].
      * [cite\_start]**Glycogen:** An energy storage molecule in **animals**, made of branched chains of glucose[cite: 49].
      * [cite\_start]**Cellulose:** A structural molecule that forms strong fibres to make up plant **cell walls**[cite: 52, 53].

-----

#### Fats and Oils (p. 5)

  * [cite\_start]**Elements:** Composed of Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O), but with a much lower proportion of oxygen than carbohydrates[cite: 66, 103].
  * **Structure:** Not a simple polymer/monomer structure. [cite\_start]Each fat molecule is made from two types of sub-units: **one glycerol** molecule and **three fatty acid** molecules[cite: 67].
  * [cite\_start]**States:** Fats are solid at room temperature, while oils are liquid[cite: 65, 103].
  * [cite\_start]**Functions:** Used as a source of energy when stored in cytoplasm and are a key component of cell membranes[cite: 80, 81].

-----

#### Proteins (p. 6)

  * **Elements:** Composed of Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and **Nitrogen (N)**. [cite\_start]Many also contain Sulfur (S)[cite: 86].
  * [cite\_start]**Monomer:** The basic sub-unit is an **amino acid**[cite: 87]. [cite\_start]There are about 20 different types of amino acids[cite: 91].
  * [cite\_start]**Polymer:** A protein is a long chain of hundreds or thousands of amino acids joined together[cite: 87, 92]. [cite\_start]The specific sequence of amino acids determines the protein's unique shape and function[cite: 92].
  * **Functions:**
      * [cite\_start]**Structural:** Form parts of cell structures like membranes, mitochondria, and chromosomes[cite: 83].
      * [cite\_start]**Functional:** Act as **enzymes** to control all the chemical reactions in a cell[cite: 84, 85].

-----

#### Structure of DNA (p. 9)

  * [cite\_start]**Structure:** A DNA molecule is a **polymer** made of two long strands of **nucleotides**[cite: 118]. [cite\_start]These two strands are twisted to form a **double helix**[cite: 126].
  * [cite\_start]**Nucleotide:** Each nucleotide (monomer) has three parts: a **phosphate** group, a **deoxyribose sugar**, and an **organic base**[cite: 119].
  * [cite\_start]**Bases:** There are four different bases: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), and Guanine (G)[cite: 120].
  * **Base Pairing Rule:** The two strands are held together by chemical bonds between the bases. [cite\_start]The pairing is highly specific: **A always pairs with T**, and **C always pairs with G**[cite: 126]. [cite\_start]This means the number of A bases equals the number of T bases, and the number of C bases equals the number of G bases[cite: 176].

### 9\) Data handling and graphing

This chapter primarily uses tables to summarize information (e.g., Table 4.1, p. 8). The main data handling skill relates to interpreting the results of the Vitamin C test.

  * **Example Data Table (from p. 20):**
    | Fruit Juice | Drops needed to decolourise DCPIP |
    | :--- | :--- |
    | A | 10 |
    | B | 18 |
    | C | 7 |
  * **Interpretation:** The dependent variable is the number of drops. The fewer drops required, the more concentrated the vitamin C.
  * **Conclusion from data:** Fruit juice C has the highest concentration of vitamin C, and fruit juice B has the lowest.

### 10\) Common misconceptions and exam tips

  * **Misconception:** All carbohydrates are sweet and soluble.

      * **Correct Understanding:** Only simple sugars (monosaccharides and disaccharides) are sweet and soluble. [cite\_start]Polysaccharides like starch and cellulose are not sweet and are insoluble[cite: 54].
      * **Tip:** Remember glucose is fuel (soluble, easy to transport), but starch is storage (insoluble, stays put).

  * **Misconception:** Fats and carbohydrates are made of the same things.

      * [cite\_start]**Correct Understanding:** Both contain C, H, and O, but fats have much less oxygen[cite: 103]. Their basic sub-units are also completely different (glucose vs. glycerol/fatty acids).
      * **Tip:** Think "Protein has Nitrogen" (P-N). Fats are C-H-O, but "O-so-little oxygen".

  * **Misconception:** There are only a few types of proteins because there are only 20 amino acids.

      * [cite\_start]**Correct Understanding:** There are vast numbers of different proteins because the 20 amino acids can be arranged in almost infinite sequences and lengths, creating unique shapes and functions[cite: 92].
      * **Tip:** Think of amino acids like letters of the alphabet. With 26 letters, we can make millions of words and sentences.

  * **Misconception:** In DNA, any base can pair with any other base.

      * [cite\_start]**Correct Understanding:** Base pairing is specific and complementary: A always pairs with T, and C always pairs with G[cite: 126].
      * **Tip:** Remember "Apple on the Tree" (A-T) and "Car in the Garage" (C-G).

### 14\) 60-second recap

This chapter covers the four essential biological molecules. **Carbohydrates** (C, H, O) are made from glucose monomers and function for energy (glucose), plant storage (starch), animal storage (glycogen), and plant structure (cellulose). **Fats** (C, H, O) are made from glycerol and fatty acids and are used for energy storage and membranes. **Proteins** (C, H, O, N) are polymers of amino acids and have structural roles and act as enzymes. **DNA** is a double helix polymer of nucleotides, carrying genetic code through its base pairs: A with T, and C with G. You can test for these nutrients: iodine turns blue-black for starch, heating with Benedict's solution gives a red precipitate for reducing sugar, Biuret reagent turns purple for protein, and ethanol plus water creates a white emulsion for fat.

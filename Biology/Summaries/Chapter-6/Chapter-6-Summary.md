### **1) Big-picture overview**

This chapter introduces **photosynthesis**, the amazing process plants use to make their own food. Think of a plant as a tiny, solar-powered factory. It takes in simple raw materials—carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil—and uses energy from sunlight to turn them into glucose, a type of sugar. This process not only feeds the plant but also releases the oxygen we breathe, making it essential for almost all life on Earth. You'll learn the chemical recipe for photosynthesis, see how the leaf is perfectly designed for this job, and discover what happens to the glucose once it's made. We'll also investigate the factors that can speed up or slow down this process, like light, temperature, and carbon dioxide levels, and understand why plants need minerals from the soil to stay healthy.

### **4) Core concepts explained**

#### **The Process of Photosynthesis** (p. 2-3)

  - Photosynthesis is the fundamental process plants use to produce their own food (p. 1).
  - It uses simple inorganic raw materials: **carbon dioxide ($CO\_2$)** from the air and **water ($H\_2O$)** from the soil (p. 2).
  - The energy for the reaction is provided by **sunlight**, which is captured by the green pigment **chlorophyll** found in chloroplasts (p. 2).
  - Chlorophyll's key role is to convert **light energy into chemical energy**, which is then used to synthesize carbohydrates (p. 2).
  - The main products are **glucose ($C\_6H\_{12}O\_6$)**, a sugar used for energy and growth, and **oxygen ($O\_2$)**, which is released as a waste product (p. 3).

#### **Use of Photosynthetic Products** (p. 4-7)

The glucose made during photosynthesis is a versatile molecule that the plant uses in several ways:

  - **For Respiration:** Glucose is broken down to release chemical energy for all other life processes, such as building proteins (p. 7).
  - **For Transport:** It is converted into **sucrose** (a soluble sugar) for transport through the phloem to other parts of the plant like roots, fruits, and flowers (p. 5).
  - **For Storage:** Excess glucose is converted into **starch** (an insoluble carbohydrate) and stored in chloroplasts, leaves, stems, or roots (like potato tubers). Being insoluble means it doesn't affect the cell's water balance (osmosis) (p. 4-5).
  - **To Build Other Molecules:**
      * **Cellulose:** Glucose molecules are chained together to form cellulose, which builds strong cell walls (p. 6).
      * **Proteins:** By combining sugars with nitrate ions from the soil, plants can make amino acids, the building blocks of proteins (p. 8).
      * **Nectar:** In flowers, sugars like glucose, fructose, and sucrose are used to produce nectar to attract pollinating insects (p. 7).

#### **Mineral Requirements** (p. 8)

Plants can't build all the molecules they need from just CO₂ and water. They also need mineral ions absorbed from the soil by their roots.

  - **Nitrate ions ($NO\_3^−$):** These are essential for making **amino acids**, which are then joined together to form **proteins**. Proteins are vital for making enzymes and cytoplasm (p. 8). A nitrate deficiency leads to stunted growth and pale leaves (p. 8).
  - **Magnesium ions ($Mg^{2+}$):** These are a central component of the **chlorophyll** molecule. Without magnesium, the plant cannot make chlorophyll, which is needed to absorb light for photosynthesis (p. 8). A magnesium deficiency causes **chlorosis**, where the leaves turn yellow (p. 8).

#### **Limiting Factors** (p. 23-24)

The rate of photosynthesis depends on several external factors. A **limiting factor** is the one in shortest supply that prevents the rate from increasing, even if other factors are optimal.

  - **Light Intensity:** As light intensity increases, the rate of photosynthesis increases, but only up to a certain point. After this 'saturation point', another factor (like CO₂ concentration or temperature) becomes limiting (p. 23).
  - **Carbon Dioxide Concentration:** Similar to light, increasing CO₂ concentration boosts the rate of photosynthesis until another factor limits it (p. 24). Artificially increasing CO₂ in glasshouses can increase crop yields (p. 24).
  - **Temperature:** Photosynthesis is controlled by enzymes, which have an optimal temperature. As temperature increases, the rate increases up to this optimum. Beyond the optimum, enzymes denature and the rate drops sharply. At very low temperatures, the rate is very slow (p. 23).

#### **Leaf Structure and Adaptations for Photosynthesis** (p. 35-43)

The leaf is highly adapted to be an efficient photosynthetic organ.

| Feature | Adaptation | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Broad, flat shape** | Large surface area, thin structure. | Maximises light absorption; provides a short diffusion distance for CO₂ (p. 36). |
| **Cuticle** | Waxy, transparent outer layer. | Reduces water loss by evaporation; allows sunlight to pass through to the mesophyll (p. 37). |
| **Upper Epidermis** | Single layer of thin, transparent cells. | Protects the leaf; allows light to penetrate to the palisade layer (p. 45). |
| **Palisade Mesophyll** | Tightly packed, column-shaped cells near the top, full of chloroplasts. | Main site of photosynthesis, positioned to receive maximum sunlight (p. 42, 45). |
| **Spongy Mesophyll** | Loosely packed, irregularly shaped cells with large air spaces. | Allows for easy diffusion of gases (CO₂, O₂, water vapour) to and from all photosynthesising cells (p. 42, 45). |
| **Vascular Bundles (Veins)** | Contain xylem and phloem tubes. | **Xylem:** transports water and minerals to the leaf cells. **Phloem:** transports sugars away from the leaf (translocation) (p. 42-43). |
| **Stomata & Guard Cells** | Pores on the leaf surface, controlled by pairs of guard cells. | Allow CO₂ to diffuse in and O₂ to diffuse out; control water loss (transpiration) (p. 37, 39). |

  - **Figure 6.23 Stoma (p. 40):** A diagram comparing an open and a closed stoma.
      * **Open stoma:** Guard cells are turgid (swollen with water) and curved, creating a pore.
      * **Closed stoma:** Guard cells are flaccid (have lost water) and less curved, closing the pore.

### **6) Processes and cycles**

#### **Photosynthesis**

1.  **Inputs:** Carbon dioxide ($CO\_2$) diffuses from the air into the leaf through the stomata. Water ($H\_2O$) is absorbed by the roots and transported to the leaf via the xylem. Light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll in the chloroplasts.
2.  **Energy Conversion:** Chlorophyll converts light energy into chemical energy. This energy is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen (p. 4).
3.  **Synthesis:** The hydrogen atoms are combined with carbon dioxide to form glucose ($C\_6H\_{12}O\_6$) (p. 4). This is a complex series of enzyme-controlled reactions.
4.  **Outputs:** Glucose is used by the plant. Oxygen ($O\_2$) is released from the leaf into the atmosphere as a waste product (p. 4).

<!-- end list -->

  - **Word Equation:**
    carbon dioxide + water $\\xrightarrow[\\text{chlorophyll}]{\\text{light energy}}$ glucose + oxygen (p. 3)
  - **Balanced Chemical Equation:**
    $6CO\_2 + 6H\_2O \\xrightarrow[\\text{chlorophyll}]{\\text{light energy}} C\_6H\_{12}O\_6 + 6O\_2$ (p. 3)

#### **Testing a Leaf for Starch**

This test is used as evidence that photosynthesis has occurred.

1.  **Destarch the plant:** Place the plant in complete darkness for 48 hours. This ensures any existing starch is used up or transported away (p. 12).
2.  **Kill the leaf:** Dip the leaf in boiling water for about 30 seconds. This stops all chemical reactions by denaturing enzymes (p. 13).
3.  **Remove chlorophyll:** Place the leaf in a test tube with ethanol (alcohol) and stand the tube in the hot water bath. The ethanol will boil and dissolve the chlorophyll, turning the leaf pale (p. 14). **Safety:** Turn off the Bunsen burner before using flammable ethanol.
4.  **Soften the leaf:** Dip the now brittle leaf back into the hot water briefly to soften it (p. 14).
5.  **Add iodine:** Spread the leaf flat on a white tile and add a few drops of iodine solution (p. 14).
6.  **Observe:** If starch is present, the iodine will turn from yellow-brown to **blue-black**. If no starch is present, it remains yellow-brown (p. 14).

### **7) Formulae and calculations**

| Quantity | Formula / Method | Units | Worked example (from p. 30) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mean rate of reaction** | Mean = (Sum of values) / (Number of values) | bubbles min⁻¹ | At 10 cm, the readings are 38, 40, 39. Mean = (38 + 40 + 39) / 3 = 39 bubbles min⁻¹ (p. 30). |
| **Identifying an anomaly** | A result that does not fit the pattern of the others. | N/A | In the data for 20 cm (15, 17, 26), the value 26 is much higher and is an anomaly. It should be excluded when calculating the mean (p. 30). |
| **Calculating mean with anomaly** | Exclude the anomalous result from the calculation. | bubbles min⁻¹ | For 20 cm, use only 15 and 17. Mean = (15 + 17) / 2 = 16 bubbles min⁻¹ (p. 30). |
| **Light intensity (from distance)** | Light Intensity ∝ 1 / (distance)² \<br\> *(This specific formula is not in the text but is standard for IGCSE)* | arbitrary units | If the lamp is moved from 10 cm to 20 cm (doubling the distance), the light intensity drops to (1/2)² = 1/4 of its original value. |

### **8) Required practicals / experiments**

#### **Investigation 1: To show chlorophyll is necessary for photosynthesis** (p. 14)

  - **Aim:** To prove that starch is only made in the parts of a leaf that contain chlorophyll.
  - **Apparatus:** A variegated plant (e.g., geranium), apparatus for starch test.
  - **Method:**
    1.  Destarch the plant for 48 hours.
    2.  Expose the plant to bright light for several hours.
    3.  Remove a variegated leaf and draw a diagram showing the green and white areas.
    4.  Test the leaf for starch using the standard procedure.
  - **Variables:**
      * **IV:** Presence/absence of chlorophyll.
      * **DV:** Presence/absence of starch (indicated by iodine).
      * **Controls:** The green part of the leaf acts as a control for the white (experimental) part. Both parts receive the same light, CO₂, and water.
  - **Expected Results:** The areas that were green turn blue-black. The areas that were white stain yellow-brown (p. 14).

#### **Investigation 2: To show light is necessary for photosynthesis** (p. 15)

  - **Aim:** To prove that light is required for a leaf to produce starch.
  - **Apparatus:** A healthy potted plant, black card or aluminium foil, paper clips, apparatus for starch test.
  - **Method:**
    1.  Destarch the plant.
    2.  Cover part of a leaf with a stencil made of black card, ensuring no light can get through to that section.
    3.  Place the plant in bright light for 4-6 hours.
    4.  Remove the leaf and the cover, then test the entire leaf for starch.
  - **Variables:**
      * **IV:** Presence/absence of light.
      * **DV:** Presence/absence of starch.
      * **Controls:** The uncovered part of the leaf acts as the control.
  - **Expected Results:** The part of the leaf exposed to light turns blue-black. The part covered by the stencil remains yellow-brown (p. 16).

#### **Investigation 3: To investigate the effect of light intensity on the rate of photosynthesis** (p. 27-28)

  - **Aim:** To measure how changing light intensity affects the rate of oxygen production by a pond plant.
  - **Apparatus:** Canadian pondweed (e.g., *Elodea*), beaker, water with sodium hydrogencarbonate (to provide CO₂), lamp, ruler, stopwatch.
  - **Method:**
    1.  Place a piece of pondweed (cut stem upwards) in a beaker of water containing sodium hydrogencarbonate.
    2.  Place a lamp 10 cm from the beaker.
    3.  Allow the plant to adjust for a few minutes, then count the number of oxygen bubbles produced in one minute. Repeat twice more and calculate a mean.
    4.  Move the lamp to 20 cm, 30 cm, 40 cm, etc., and repeat the counts at each distance.
  - **Variables:**
      * **IV:** Light intensity (changed by varying the distance of the lamp).
      * **DV:** Rate of photosynthesis (measured by bubbles of oxygen produced per minute).
      * **Controls:** CO₂ concentration (kept constant by sodium hydrogencarbonate), temperature.
  - **Safety:** Handle mains electricity lamp with dry hands.
  - **Sources of Error:** Bubbles may be different sizes; counting fast bubbles is difficult; heat from the lamp can affect the rate.
  - **Improvements:** Collect the gas in a measuring cylinder to measure volume instead of counting bubbles; place a heat shield (beaker of water) between the lamp and the plant.
  - **Expected Results:** As the distance of the lamp increases, light intensity decreases, and the rate of bubbling decreases (p. 29). A graph of rate vs. 1/d² should show an initial increase followed by a plateau.

-----

### **9) Data handling and graphing**

  - **Tables:** Used to record results from experiments, often with repeat readings to calculate a mean (p. 30). You must be able to calculate the mean and identify/exclude anomalous results before plotting.
  - **Line Graphs:** These are used to show the relationship between a continuous independent variable (e.g., light intensity, temperature, CO₂ concentration) and a continuous dependent variable (rate of photosynthesis).
      * **Axes:** The independent variable (what you change, e.g., light intensity) goes on the x-axis. The dependent variable (what you measure, e.g., rate of photosynthesis) goes on the y-axis.
      * **Trends:** For limiting factor graphs (Figure 6.13, p. 25), look for two key parts:
        1.  **A rising section:** Where the factor on the x-axis is the limiting factor. The line slopes upwards.
        2.  **A plateau (flat section):** Where the factor on the x-axis is no longer limiting; something else is. The line is horizontal.
  - **Exam Prompts:**
      * "Calculate the mean..."
      * "Plot a graph of these results..."
      * "Describe the trend shown in the graph..." (state the relationship between the variables).
      * "Explain the shape of the graph..." (use your knowledge of limiting factors).
      * "Identify the limiting factor at point X..."

### **10) Common misconceptions and exam tips**

  - **Misconception:** Plants only respire at night.
      - **Correct Understanding:** Plants respire **24 hours a day** to release energy for life processes. During the day, the rate of photosynthesis is usually much higher than respiration, so there is a net intake of CO₂ and output of O₂ (p. 20).
      - **Quick Tip:** Respiration = Always on. Photosynthesis = Only in light.
  - **Misconception:** A plant's "food" comes from the soil.
      - **Correct Understanding:** Plants get water and mineral ions from the soil, but their food (glucose) is made in the leaves using CO₂ from the air (p. 2). The mass of a plant comes mostly from the air, not the soil.
      - **Quick Tip:** Soil provides the 'vitamins' (minerals), but the air provides the 'calories' (carbon for glucose).
  - **Misconception:** Photosynthesis is the reverse of aerobic respiration.
      - **Correct Understanding:** While the overall equations look opposite, they are completely different metabolic pathways, using different enzymes and occurring in different organelles (chloroplasts vs. mitochondria).
      - **Quick Tip:** Think of them as two different factories: one builds sugar (photosynthesis), the other breaks it down (respiration).
  - **Exam Tip:** When asked about leaf adaptations, link **structure to function**. Don't just list the parts. For example, "The palisade cells are packed with chloroplasts (structure) in order to maximise light absorption for photosynthesis (function)."

### **11) Exam‑style practice**

**Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)**

1.  What is the correct balanced chemical equation for photosynthesis?
    A) $C\_6H\_{12}O\_6 + 6O\_2 \\rightarrow 6CO\_2 + 6H\_2O$
    B) $6CO\_2 + 6H\_2O \\rightarrow C\_6H\_{12}O\_6 + 6O\_2$
    C) $CO\_2 + H\_2O \\rightarrow C\_6H\_{12}O\_6 + O\_2$
    D) $6O\_2 + 6H\_2O \\rightarrow C\_6H\_{12}O\_6 + 6CO\_2$

    > **Answer: B.** This is the correct balanced equation with 6 molecules of carbon dioxide and water producing one molecule of glucose and 6 molecules of oxygen (p. 3).

2.  A plant is deficient in magnesium ions. Which symptom is it most likely to show?
    A) Stunted growth
    B) Wilting
    C) Yellowing leaves (chlorosis)
    D) Poor fruit development

    > **Answer: C.** Magnesium is needed to make chlorophyll. Without it, the leaves cannot become green and appear yellow (p. 8).

3.  In an experiment to investigate the effect of a factor on photosynthesis, why is the plant destarched first?
    A) To remove the chlorophyll from the leaves.
    B) To ensure that any starch detected at the end was made during the experiment.
    C) To make the leaves more permeable to iodine.
    D) To increase the rate of photosynthesis.

    > **Answer: B.** Destarching ensures there is no starch in the leaf at the start, so its presence at the end is valid proof of photosynthesis (p. 12).

4.  Which part of the leaf has the primary function of gas exchange?
    A) Palisade mesophyll
    B) Xylem
    C) Cuticle
    D) Stomata

    > **Answer: D.** Stomata are the pores that open and close to allow gases like CO₂ and O₂ to move in and out of the leaf (p. 37).

5.  A graph shows the rate of photosynthesis plotted against light intensity. The line becomes horizontal at high light intensities. What is the best explanation for this?
    A) All the chlorophyll has been destroyed.
    B) The temperature has become too high.
    C) Another factor, such as CO₂ concentration, has become limiting.
    D) The plant has run out of water.

    > **Answer: C.** When the graph plateaus, it means increasing the factor on the x-axis (light) has no further effect because another factor is in short supply and is now limiting the rate (p. 23).

6.  How is glucose from the leaves transported to the roots?
    A) As starch in the xylem
    B) As sucrose in the phloem
    C) As glucose in the xylem
    D) As starch in the phloem

7.  What is the function of the waxy cuticle on a leaf?
    A) To absorb water
    B) To reduce water loss
    C) To perform photosynthesis
    D) To transport sugars

    > **Answer: B.** The waxy layer is waterproof and reduces evaporation from the leaf surface (p. 37).

8.  Nitrate ions are essential for plants to produce which biological molecule?
    A) Starch
    B) Cellulose
    C) Proteins
    D) Fats

    > **Answer: C.** Nitrates provide the nitrogen needed to make amino acids, which are the monomers of proteins (p. 8).

9.  Which cells in the leaf contain the most chloroplasts?
    A) Upper epidermal cells
    B) Guard cells
    C) Spongy mesophyll cells
    D) Palisade mesophyll cells

    > **Answer: D.** Palisade cells are located at the top of the leaf to receive maximum sunlight and are packed with chloroplasts to be the main site of photosynthesis (p. 43).

10. In an experiment using pondweed and a lamp, how is the rate of photosynthesis measured?
    A) By the change in colour of the leaves
    B) By the increase in mass of the pondweed
    C) By counting the bubbles of gas produced per minute
    D) By measuring the amount of water absorbed

    > **Answer: C.** The gas produced is oxygen, a product of photosynthesis, so the rate of bubbling is a proxy for the rate of reaction (p. 28).

**Short-Answer Questions**

1.  **State two ways a plant uses the glucose it produces during photosynthesis.**

    >   - Used in respiration to release energy (1).
    >   - Converted to starch for storage (1).
    >   - *(Also correct: Converted to sucrose for transport; used to make cellulose for cell walls)* (p. 4-7).

2.  **Explain why a leaf tested for starch is first placed in boiling water and then in hot ethanol.**

    >   - **Boiling water:** To kill the leaf and denature enzymes, stopping any further chemical reactions (1).
    >   - **Hot ethanol:** To remove the chlorophyll (which is soluble in ethanol) so that the colour change of the iodine can be seen (1) (p. 13-14).

3.  **A farmer grows tomatoes in a glasshouse. Suggest two ways they could increase the rate of photosynthesis to improve their crop yield.**

    >   - Increase the carbon dioxide concentration in the air (e.g., using a CO₂ generator) (1).
    >   - Increase the light intensity (e.g., using artificial lights, especially in winter) or increase the temperature (e.g., using heaters) (1) (p. 24).

4.  **Describe the function of the palisade mesophyll and the spongy mesophyll in a leaf.**

    >   - **Palisade mesophyll:** Main site of photosynthesis due to its cells being packed with chloroplasts and positioned near the top of the leaf for maximum light absorption (1).
    >   - **Spongy mesophyll:** Contains air spaces that allow for efficient diffusion of gases (CO₂ and O₂) to and from the palisade cells (1) (p. 42).

5.  **Explain the term 'limiting factor' in the context of photosynthesis.**

    > A limiting factor is a factor (such as light, CO₂ or temperature) which is in the shortest supply (1) and therefore restricts or 'limits' the rate of photosynthesis, even if the other factors are at their optimum level (1) (p. 23).

### **13) Flashcards (ready‑to‑use)**

| Question | Answer |
| :--- | :--- |
| What is photosynthesis? | The process where plants use light energy to make carbohydrates (glucose) from carbon dioxide and water. (p. 1) |
| What is the word equation for photosynthesis? | carbon dioxide + water $\\xrightarrow{\\text{light/chlorophyll}}$ glucose + oxygen (p. 3) |
| What is the function of chlorophyll? | To absorb light energy and convert it into chemical energy. (p. 2) |
| Why do plants need nitrate ions? | To make amino acids, which are used to build proteins. (p. 8) |
| Why do plants need magnesium ions? | To make chlorophyll. A lack of magnesium causes yellow leaves (chlorosis). (p. 8) |
| How do plants store excess glucose? | They convert it into insoluble starch. (p. 4) |
| How do plants transport sugar from leaves? | They convert glucose to sucrose, which is transported in the phloem. (p. 5) |
| Name the main photosynthetic tissue in a leaf. | The palisade mesophyll. (p. 42) |
| What is the function of the leaf's spongy mesophyll layer? | The air spaces allow for easy diffusion of CO₂ to the photosynthesising cells. (p. 42) |
| What is a stoma? | A pore in the leaf epidermis that allows for gas exchange. (p. 37) |
| How do guard cells open the stoma? | They take in water, become turgid and curve outwards. (p. 39) |
| What is a limiting factor? | A factor in short supply (e.g., light) that restricts the rate of photosynthesis. (p. 23) |
| What are the three main limiting factors for photosynthesis? | Light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration, and temperature. (p. 23-24) |
| What is the test for starch? | Add iodine solution. A blue-black colour indicates starch is present. (p. 14) |
| Why is a leaf boiled in ethanol before testing for starch? | To remove the green chlorophyll, which would hide the iodine colour change. (p. 14) |
| What is the role of the xylem in a leaf? | To transport water and minerals to the leaf cells. (p. 42) |
| What is translocation? | The transport of sugars (as sucrose) in the phloem. (p. 43) |

### **14) 60-second recap**

Plant nutrition is all about photosynthesis, the process of converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen using light energy trapped by chlorophyll. The balanced equation is $6CO\_2 + 6H\_2O \\rightarrow C\_6H\_{12}O\_6 + 6O\_2$. This glucose is vital: it's used for respiration, stored as starch, transported as sucrose, or built into cellulose. The leaf is perfectly adapted for this, with a large surface area, palisade cells packed with chloroplasts, and stomata for gas exchange. However, the rate of photosynthesis can be held back by limiting factors: a shortage of light, carbon dioxide, or a non-optimal temperature. Plants also need minerals from the soil, especially nitrates for proteins and magnesium for chlorophyll.

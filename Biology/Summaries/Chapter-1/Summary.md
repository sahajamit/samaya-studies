### 1\) Big-picture overview (100–150 words)

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of what it means to be alive and how scientists organise the vast diversity of life on Earth. It starts with the seven essential characteristics that all living things share, easily remembered by the mnemonic **MRS GREN**. You'll learn why a universal classification system is crucial, moving beyond simple groupings to a natural system based on shared features and evolutionary history. The chapter explains the **binomial system** for naming species, a key tool for scientists worldwide. It then dives into the major groups, or **kingdoms**, of life: Animals, Plants, Fungi, Protoctists, and Prokaryotes, detailing the key features of each. You'll explore the main classes within the animal kingdom (like arthropods and vertebrates) and plant kingdom (ferns and flowering plants), learning to identify them using their distinct characteristics.

### 4\) Core concepts explained

#### **Characteristics of Living Organisms (p. 1)**

All living things share seven key characteristics. A useful mnemonic to remember them is **MRS GREN**.

  * **M**ovement: Changing position or place.
  * **R**espiration: Releasing energy from food.
  * **S**ensitivity: Detecting and responding to stimuli.
  * **G**rowth: Permanently increasing in size.
  * **R**eproduction: Producing more of the same kind of organism.
  * **E**xcretion: Removing metabolic waste.
  * **N**utrition: Taking in materials for energy and growth.

-----

#### **Classification and Naming (pp. 3-5)**

  * **Why Classify?** With millions of species, classification brings a meaningful order to the diversity of life (p. 3).
  * **Natural vs. Artificial Systems:** Biologists use **natural systems** based on important shared features that reflect evolutionary relationships (e.g., all birds have feathers). **Artificial systems**, like grouping animals by colour, are not meaningful because they don't reflect ancestry (p. 3).
  * **Hierarchy:** The smallest natural group is the **species**. Closely related species are grouped into a **genus** (p. 4).
  * **Binomial System:** This is the universal method for naming species, developed to avoid the confusion of common names (p. 4).
      * It uses two Latin words: The first is the **Genus** (always capitalised), and the second is the **species** (always lowercase).
      * Example: The Indian robin is *Copsychus fulicatus*, while the British robin is *Erithacus rubecula*. Using these names avoids confusion between the two different species (p. 4).

-----

#### **Using Dichotomous Keys (pp. 6-9)**

  * **Purpose:** Dichotomous keys are tools used to identify unknown organisms (p. 6).
  * **Structure:** "Dichotomous" means 'two branches'. The key consists of a series of paired, contrasting statements or questions.
  * **How to Use:** At each step, you choose the statement that best describes the organism. This choice leads you to the next pair of statements, or to the identification of the organism.

-----

#### **Classification, Anatomy and DNA (pp. 10-17)**

  * **Evolutionary Relationships:** Modern classification aims to reflect evolutionary history. Organisms with a more recent common ancestor are grouped more closely together (p. 14).
  * **Anatomical Evidence:** A key piece of evidence is the **homologous structure**, such as the **pentadactyl limb** found in vertebrates (human, lizard, bird, whale, bat) (p. 12-13). Although the limbs perform different functions (e.g., flying, swimming), they share the same basic bone pattern, suggesting they all evolved from a common ancestor.
  * **DNA Evidence:** Comparing the sequence of bases in the DNA of different organisms is a powerful tool for classification (p. 16).
      * The more similar the DNA base sequences are between two species, the more closely related they are (i.e., they share a more recent common ancestor) (p. 16).
      * For example, DNA analysis shows humans are more closely related to chimpanzees (1.2% genome difference) than to orangutans (3.1% difference) (p. 16).

#### **The Five Kingdoms of Life (pp. 18, 36-47)**

Biologists often use a five-kingdom scheme to classify all living organisms.

| Feature | Animal | Plant | Fungus | Protoctist | Prokaryote |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cell type** | Eukaryotic | Eukaryotic | Eukaryotic | Eukaryotic | Prokaryotic |
| **Number of cells** | Multicellular | Multicellular | Mostly multicellular (hyphae) | Mostly unicellular | Unicellular |
| **Cell wall** | No | Yes (cellulose) | Yes (chitin) | Some have walls | Yes (not cellulose) |
| **Nutrition** | Heterotrophic (ingestion) | Autotrophic (photosynthesis) | Heterotrophic (saprotrophic) | Autotrophic or Heterotrophic | Various modes |
| **Nucleus** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No (nucleoid region) |
| **Example** | Mammal, Insect | Fern, Flowering plant | Mushroom, Yeast | *Amoeba*, *Euglena* | Bacteria |
| **Exam Note** | Viruses are not in any kingdom as they are not true cells and cannot perform life processes on their own (p. 36). They are composed of genetic material (DNA or RNA) inside a protein coat (p. 47). |

-----

#### **The Animal Kingdom: Arthropods vs. Vertebrates (pp. 24-35)**

This chapter focuses on two major animal phyla:

| Feature | Arthropods | Vertebrates | Exam Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Skeleton** | External (exoskeleton) | Internal (endoskeleton) | The term 'invertebrate' is a convenience for all animals without a backbone, not a formal group (p. 23). |
| **Key feature** | Jointed limbs | Vertebral column (spine) | |
| **Examples** | Insects, Spiders, Crabs | Fish, Birds, Mammals | |

**Classes of Arthropods (p. 28)**

#### **The Plant Kingdom: Ferns vs. Flowering Plants (pp. 37-42)**

| Feature | Ferns | Flowering Plants | Exam Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Key structures**| Have roots, stems, and leaves | Have roots, stems, leaves, and flowers | |
| **Reproduction** | By spores (found on the underside of leaves) | By seeds (produced in flowers, enclosed in an ovary) | Ferns are non-seed-bearing plants. |

**Types of Flowering Plants (p. 42)**

### 5\) Diagrams and micrographs (figures)

  * **Pentadactyl Limb (Figure 1.9, p. 12-13)**

      * **What it shows:** The limb skeletons of five different vertebrates (human, lizard, bird, whale, bat), illustrating a homologous structure.
      * **Labels:** Humerus (one upper arm bone), Radius and Ulna (two forearm bones), Carpals (wrist bones), Metacarpals and Phalanges (five groups of hand/finger bones).
      * **To redraw:** Draw a single bone connected by a hinge joint to two parallel bones. These connect to a block of small wrist bones, which then branch out into five "finger" bones.

  * **External Features of an Insect (Figure 1.16, p. 26)**

      * **What it shows:** A typical insect body plan (greenbottle fly).
      * **Labels:** Head (with one pair of antennae, compound eyes), Thorax (with three pairs of legs, wings attached), Abdomen (segmented).

      * **What it shows:** The difference in leaf venation between monocots and dicots.
      * **Labels (Monocot):** Parallel veins running the length of a narrow leaf.
      * **Labels (Dicot):** Main vein with a branching network of smaller veins in a broad leaf.

  * **Generalised Structure of a Virus (Figure 1.36, p. 47)**

      * **What it shows:** The basic components of a non-cellular virus particle.
      * **Labels:** Central core of genetic material (labelled as an RNA strand), surrounded by a protein coat (capsid). Viruses have no nucleus, cytoplasm, or organelles.

### 6\) Processes and cycles

**Using a Dichotomous Key (p. 6)**

  * **Step 1:** Start at the first pair of statements (couplet 1).
  * **Step 2:** Observe the unknown organism and decide which of the two statements best describes it.
  * **Step 3:** Follow the instruction at the end of that statement. It will either identify the organism or direct you to another couplet.
  * **Step 4:** Repeat the process until the organism is identified.
  * **Inputs → Outputs:** Input is an unknown organism; output is its identification.
  * **Common Error:** Misinterpreting a feature or choosing the wrong statement. Always read both options carefully before deciding.

### 7\) Formulae and calculations

| Quantity | Formula | Units | Worked example (from p. 51) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Percentage of a subgroup | $(\\frac{\\text{Number in subgroup}}{\\text{Total number in main group}}) \\times 100$ | % | **Calculate what percentage of arthropods are arachnids.**\<br\>1. **Find total arthropods:** 4.5% (arachnids) + 56.3% (insects) + 2.4% (crustaceans) + 1.2% (other arthropods) = 64.4% of all species.\<br\>2. **Use the formula:** $(\\frac{4.5}{64.4}) \\times 100 = 6.987...$\<br\>3. **Answer:** Arachnids make up approximately **7.0%** of all arthropods (to 2 sig. figs.). |

### 8\) Required practicals / experiments

Not covered in this chapter.

### 9\) Data handling and graphing

  * **Comparison Tables:** The chapter uses tables extensively to compare the features of different groups (e.g., Arthropod classes, p. 28; Vertebrate classes, p. 35; Monocots vs. Dicots, p. 42). Exam questions may ask you to extract data from such tables or to create one.
  * **Dichotomous Keys:** These are a form of data sorting. You need to be able to use a provided key to identify an organism and construct your own simple key for a given set of organisms.
  * **Evolutionary Trees (Phylogenetic Trees):** Figure 1.12 (p. 17) is an evolutionary tree for primates.
      * **How to read it:** The vertical axis represents time (past at the bottom, present at the top). Branching points represent a common ancestor. Organisms on branches that split more recently are more closely related.
      * **Exam prompt:** "Which two species share the most recent common ancestor?" Look for the two species whose branches join closest to the top of the diagram. In Fig 1.12, this is the chimpanzee and bonobo.

### 10\) Common misconceptions and exam tips

  * **Misconception:** Viruses are a type of simple, living cell.

      * **Correct Understanding:** Viruses are not cells and are not considered truly living (p. 36). They lack cytoplasm, organelles, and cannot reproduce without a host cell.
      * **Quick Tip:** Remember, "No cell, no life."

  * **Misconception:** "Cold-blooded" means an animal's blood is always cold.

      * **Correct Understanding:** It means the animal's body temperature is variable and depends on the external environment. They are more accurately called poikilotherms (p. 29).
      * **Quick Tip:** Cold-blooded = variable temperature; Warm-blooded = constant temperature.

  * **Misconception:** Spiders, crabs, and centipedes are all insects.

      * **Correct Understanding:** They are all arthropods, but belong to different classes. Insects are defined by having 6 legs and 3 body parts (p. 28).
      * **Quick Tip:** Count the legs\! 6 = Insect, 8 = Arachnid, 10+ = Crustacean/Myriapod.

  * **Misconception:** The binomial name can be written in any case (e.g., homo Sapiens).

      * **Correct Understanding:** The format is strict: *Genus* (capitalised) *species* (lowercase) (p. 5).
      * **Quick Tip:** First name is a capital, second is small. Genus gets the "capital treatment."

### 14\) 60-second recap

This chapter covers the seven characteristics of life, remembered as MRS GREN. All life is organised into groups based on shared features and evolutionary history. We name organisms using the two-part binomial system: *Genus species*. We can identify them using dichotomous keys. Classification reflects evolution, with anatomical evidence like the pentadactyl limb and molecular evidence from DNA showing how closely species are related. Life is divided into five kingdoms. Animals are multicellular heterotrophs, including arthropods (insects, arachnids) and vertebrates (fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals). Plants are multicellular autotrophs, including ferns (spores) and flowering plants (seeds), which are split into monocots and dicots. Fungi are decomposers with chitin cell walls. Protoctists are mostly unicellular eukaryotes, and Prokaryotes are unicellular without a nucleus. Viruses are non-cellular particles, not classified as living.

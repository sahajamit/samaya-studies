### 1) Big‑picture overview (100–150 words)

This chapter introduces the fundamental concept that all living things are made of cells. It begins by exploring the microscopic world, detailing the structures (organelles) inside animal, plant, and bacterial cells and explaining the specific job each part does. You'll learn the key differences between these cell types, such as the cell wall and chloroplasts found in plants. The chapter then zooms out to show how cells don't work in isolation. It explains the hierarchy of organisation: similar cells group to form tissues, different tissues combine to make organs, organs work together in organ systems, and all these systems make up a complete organism. Finally, it covers the practical skills of using a light microscope and performing essential calculations to determine the magnification and actual size of the specimens you observe.

### 4) Core concepts explained

#### **Cell Structure (p. 2-14)**

* All living organisms are made of fundamental units called **cells** (p. 2).
* Cells are studied using microscopes, often by observing thin slices called **sections**. A slice along the length is a **longitudinal section**, and a slice across is a **transverse section** (p. 3).
* All cells contain **cytoplasm**, a **cell membrane**, and most have a **nucleus**. Many cellular processes occur in the cytoplasm, which also contains specialised structures called **organelles** (p. 5-6).
* **Mitochondria** are organelles where aerobic respiration occurs to release energy (p. 11). **Ribosomes** are responsible for making proteins (p. 10).

**Comparison of Animal and Plant Cells (p. 5-10)**

| Feature | Animal Cell (e.g., Liver cell) | Plant Cell (e.g., Palisade cell) | Exam Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cell Wall** | Absent | Present (made of cellulose) | Provides rigid support to the plant cell. Freely permeable. |
| **Cell Membrane**| Present | Present | Partially permeable; controls entry/exit of substances. |
| **Cytoplasm** | Present | Present | Site of most chemical reactions. |
| **Nucleus** | Present | Present | Controls cell activities and division. |
| **Chloroplasts** | Absent | Present (in photosynthetic parts) | Site of photosynthesis. |
| **Vacuole** | Small, temporary (if present) | Large, central, permanent | Contains cell sap; helps maintain turgor pressure. |
| **Shape** | Irregular / rounded | Fixed / regular shape | The cell wall gives a fixed shape. |

**Bacterial Cell Structure (p. 13-14)**

* Bacteria are single-celled organisms, much smaller and simpler than plant or animal cells.
* They have a **cell wall**, but it is **not made of cellulose** (p. 13).
* They **do not have a true nucleus**. Instead, their genetic material is a single circular chromosome of DNA located in the cytoplasm (p. 14).
* They may also have small, circular rings of DNA called **plasmids** (p. 14).
* They lack mitochondria but have ribosomes for protein synthesis (p. 13).

---

#### **Specialisation of Cells (p. 21-25)**

* Most cells in multicellular organisms become **specialised**, meaning they develop a distinct shape and structure to perform a specific function. This is known as the **division of labour** (p. 22).
* **Ciliated cells:** Line the windpipe; have tiny hairs (cilia) that move mucus away from the lungs (p. 23).
* **Root hair cells:** Have a long extension to increase surface area for absorbing water and minerals from the soil (p. 23).
* **Palisade mesophyll cells:** Packed with chloroplasts to maximise light absorption for photosynthesis (p. 23).
* **Nerve cells (neurones):** Are long to transmit electrical impulses over large distances in the body (p. 24).
* **Red blood cells:** Have no nucleus when mature to maximise space for haemoglobin, which transports oxygen (p. 24).
* **Sperm cells:** Have a tail for swimming and mitochondria for energy to reach the egg (p. 25).
* **Egg cells (ova):** Are large and contain a food store (yolk) for the developing embryo (p. 25).

---

#### **Levels of Organisation (p. 26-31)**

* In complex organisms, cells are organised into a hierarchy.
* **Tissue:** A group of similar cells working together (e.g., muscle tissue) (p. 26).
* **Organ:** A structure made of different tissues working together for a specific purpose (e.g., the stomach, which contains muscle tissue, epithelial tissue, and glandular tissue) (p. 29).
* **Organ System:** A group of organs working together to perform a major function (e.g., the digestive system, including the stomach, intestines, and oesophagus) (p. 29).
* **Organism:** The complete living being, formed by all the organ systems working together (p. 31).

### 6) Processes and cycles

**Cell Division (p. 7, 14)**

This is the process by which new cells are produced from existing cells.

* **Animal Cell Division (as shown in Figure 2.5, p. 7):**
    1.  An animal cell prepares to divide.
    2.  The **nucleus divides first**, ensuring each new cell gets a full copy of the genetic material.
    3.  The two new 'daughter' nuclei separate to opposite ends of the cell.
    4.  The **cytoplasm divides** by pinching inwards in the middle.
    5.  Two separate, smaller cells are formed.

* **Bacterial Cell Division (as shown in Figure 2.11, p. 14):**
    1.  The single circular chromosome replicates (makes a copy of itself).
    2.  The cell elongates and the cytoplasm begins to divide.
    3.  A new cell wall forms, separating the cell into two genetically identical daughter cells. This process is called binary fission.

### 7) Formulae and calculations

| Quantity | Formula | Units | Typical values | Worked example (with sig. figs.) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Magnification (microscope)** | Eyepiece lens mag. $\times$ Objective lens mag. | None ($\times$) | Eyepiece: $\times10$; Objective: $\times4, \times10, \times40$. Total: $\times40$ to $\times400$. | Eyepiece = $\times10$, Objective = $\times40$. Total Mag. = $10 \times 40 = \times400$ (p. 33). |
| **Magnification (of a drawing)** | $Magnification = \frac{Image \ size}{Actual \ size}$ | None ($\times$) | $\times50$ to $\times5000$ in exam questions. | A cell drawing is 6 cm (60 mm) wide. Its actual size is 0.1 mm. Magnification = 60 mm / 0.1 mm = $\times600$ (p. 35). |
| **Actual Size (from a drawing)** | $Actual \ size = \frac{Image \ size}{Magnification}$ | mm or $\mu$m | Cells are typically 10–100 $\mu$m. | An image of a cell is 2.5 cm (25 mm) wide. Magnification is $\times500$. Actual size = 25 mm / 500 = 0.05 mm (p. 35). |

**Unit Conversions (p. 36):**
* 1 millimetre (mm) = 1000 micrometres ($\mu$m)
* To convert mm to $\mu$m, multiply by 1000.
* To convert $\mu$m to mm, divide by 1000.

### 8) Required practicals / experiments

#### **1. Preparing a slide of onion epidermis cells (p. 15-16)**

* **Aim:** To prepare and observe plant cells using a light microscope.
* **Apparatus:** Onion, microscope slide, coverslip, forceps, scalpel, mounted needle, iodine solution, light microscope.
* **Method:**
    1.  Use forceps to peel a thin, transparent layer of epidermis from the inside of an onion leaf.
    2.  Place the tissue flat on a microscope slide.
    3.  Add a few drops of **iodine solution** (a stain to make the nucleus more visible).
    4.  Lower a coverslip carefully at an angle to avoid trapping air bubbles.
    5.  Observe under the microscope, starting with the lowest power objective lens.
* **Safety:** Wear eye protection. Take care with the scalpel and with iodine, which can stain skin and clothes (p. 15).
* **Sources of error:** Trapping air bubbles which obscure the view; tissue folded over on itself.
* **Expected results:** A single layer of rectangular, closely-packed cells. The cell wall, cytoplasm, and a yellowish-brown nucleus should be visible (see Figure 2.13, p. 18).

#### **2. Preparing human cheek cells (p. 19-20)**

* **Aim:** To prepare and observe animal cells using a light microscope.
* **Apparatus:** Fresh cotton bud, microscope slide, coverslip, methylene blue dye, disinfectant, light microscope.
* **Method:**
    1.  Gently rub a cotton bud on the inside of your cheek.
    2.  Smear the cotton bud onto the centre of a clean slide.
    3.  Add a few drops of **methylene blue dye** (a stain to make the nucleus visible).
    4.  Carefully lower a coverslip.
    5.  Observe under the microscope, starting at low power.
* **Safety:** Treat all contaminated items (cotton bud, slide) with disinfectant afterwards (p. 19).
* **Sources of error:** Sample too thick; air bubbles trapped under the coverslip.
* **Expected results:** Irregularly shaped cells, scattered on the slide. A cell membrane, cytoplasm, and a dark blue nucleus should be visible in each cell (see Figure 2.15, p. 20).

### 9) Data handling and graphing

This chapter focuses on calculation rather than graphing.
* **Calculations from images:** The primary data skill is using the magnification formula. You will often be given a photomicrograph with a scale bar or a magnification value.
* **Typical exam prompts:**
    1.  "Measure the diameter of the cell shown in the image." (Requires using a ruler).
    2.  "The magnification of the image is $\times800$. Calculate the actual diameter of the cell. Show your working and give your answer in micrometres ($\mu$m)." (Requires measurement, formula rearrangement, and unit conversion).
    3.  "The scale bar represents 10 $\mu$m. Calculate the magnification of the image." (Requires measuring the image size of the scale bar and using the magnification formula).
* **Tables:** You may be asked to complete tables comparing the features of different cell types (see Exam-style questions, p. 37-38).

---

### 10) Common misconceptions and exam tips

* **Misconception:** Plant cells only have a cell wall.
    * **Correct understanding:** Plant cells have **both** a cell wall on the outside and a cell membrane just inside it (p. 8). The cell membrane still controls what enters and leaves the cytoplasm.
    * **Quick tip:** The wall is like a strong box (support), the membrane is like a security guard (control).

* **Misconception:** All plant cells can photosynthesise.
    * **Correct understanding:** Only plant cells with chloroplasts can photosynthesise. Cells not exposed to light, like root hair cells or onion epidermal cells, do not have chloroplasts.
    * **Quick tip:** No light = No need for chloroplasts.

* **Misconception:** Magnification has units.
    * **Correct understanding:** Magnification is a ratio (e.g., image size in mm / actual size in mm). The units cancel out, so it is written as, for example, '$\times500$'.
    * **Quick tip:** Always convert both measurements to the *same unit* before you divide. This is the most common source of error.

* **Exam Tip:** When asked to compare two cell types (e.g., plant vs. animal), always make a direct point of comparison. Use words like "whereas" or "but". For example, "Plant cells have a cell wall, whereas animal cells do not."

### 14) 60‑second recap

This chapter builds biology from the ground up. It starts with the cell, the basic unit of life, and details the key organelles like the nucleus for control, mitochondria for energy, and the cell membrane as a gatekeeper. We learn that plant cells have three extra parts: a supportive cellulose cell wall, chloroplasts for photosynthesis, and a large central vacuole. Bacterial cells are simpler, with no true nucleus. These cells then specialise for specific jobs—like long root hairs for absorption or red blood cells without a nucleus to carry more oxygen. Cells group into tissues, tissues form organs, organs create systems, and systems make up the whole organism. To see any of this, we use a microscope, and you must be able to calculate magnification by dividing the image size by the actual size, remembering to keep the units consistent.
